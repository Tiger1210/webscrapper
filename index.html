<h2>
Man City meet PSG and Messi in the pick of the Champions League groups as Liverpool get Atletico and Chelsea face Juventus... and it's a dream draw for Man United, who have a Villarreal rematch </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/18/47139637-0-image-m-3_1629998773437.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Manchester City will face Lionel Messi and Paris Saint-Germain in this season's Champions League group stage as Thursday's draw threw up some mouthwatering clashes.<br>
</p>
<p>
Reigning champions Chelsea will do battle with Juventus after being pitted together in Group H, while Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool will be making a return to the Wanda Metropolitano stadium after being draw against reigning Spanish champions Atletico Madrid in Group B, as well as Porto and AC Milan.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Man City face a battle of the riches after being paired with none other than PSG in Group A, as their north west rivals Manchester United will dive into a re-run of last season's Europa League final after being drawn against Villarreal in Group F, along with Atalanta and BSC Young Boys.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea and Juve will be joined in group H by Russian outfit Zenit St Petersburg and Swedish titans Malmo.<br>
</p>
<p>
In Group A City and PSG will also face potential underdogs RB Leipzig who have upset the apple cart in German football in recent years, as Club Brugge make up the group.<br>
</p>
<p>
The eyes of football fans around the world are likely to be lasered onto Group A, with Messi having made the switch to Paris earlier this summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
A showdown between City and PSG will be ramped up further if speculation over a shock Cristiano Ronaldo move to Manchester City - to join the rivals of his former club - turns out to be true.<br>
</p>
<p>
The draw was assisted by former Chelsea midfield maestro Michael Essien, who helped pluck the balls from the containers and select the match-ups, along with his ex-team mate Branislav Ivanovic.<br>
</p>
<p>
Across the other groups an interesting showdown has been served up in Group E, with Barcelona and Bayern Munich going head to head with Benfica and Dynamo Kiev thrown into the mix.<br>
</p>
<p>
Group D sees Real Madrid meet Inter Milan, with Shakhtar Donestk and Moldovan side FC Sheriff Tiraspoll.<br>
</p>
<p>
In Group G, perhaps the most kind selection of sides have been picked out to meet one another. Spanish giants Sevilla will very much fancy their chances, in a group which also includes Lille, Salzburg and Wolfsburg.<br>
</p>
<p>
Completing the full set of fixtures for the first stage of the competition is Group C comprising Sporting Lisbon, Borussia Dortmund, Ajax and Besiktas.<br>
</p>
<p>
During the ceremony a run-down of the big individual awards was also announced, for players who performed above their peers during last season's Champions League competition.<br>
</p>
<p>
Predictably, the final three-man shortlist in each positional category were largely dominated by the finalists Man City and Chelsea.<br>
</p>
<p>
Blues stopper Edouard Mendy took the Goalkeeper of the Year award, while City's Ruben Dias won Defender of the Year.<br>
</p>
<p>
N'Golo Kante scooped Midfielder of the Year, while Dortmund's free-scoring Erling Haaland proudly accepted the Striker of the Year accolade.<br>
</p>
<p>
The big solo award that everyone had been waiting for - UEFA Men's Player of the Year - was chopped down to a final three of Kante, Kevin De Bruyne and Jorginho.<br>
</p>
<p>
Representatives from each competing team watched on as Chelsea general Jorginho won the honour, after his starring role in seeing the Blues triumph in Porto, along with his successful summer of guiding Italy to the title of European Championship winners. <br>

<h2>
PSG REJECT Real Madrid's £154m offer for Kylian Mbappe, with the French giants desperate to draw a line under the transfer saga so it doesn't overshadow Lionel Messi's debut in Ligue 1 against Reims this weekend </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/19/47142173-0-image-a-28_1630003312433.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Real Madrid have tabled a second bid of £154million (180m euros) for Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe.<br>
</p>
<p>
But the French club’s president Nasser Al-Khelaifi rejected it saying: ‘Our position is clear. We will not change it or repeat it.’ <br>
</p>
<p>
The improved offer, confirmed by the Spanish club to Sportsmail, is of £145.8m (170m euros) plus £8.5meuros (10m euros) in add-ons. <br>
</p>
<p>
PSG had reacted angrily to Madrid’s first bid on Tuesday of 160m euros. <br>
</p>
<p>
Sporting Director Leonard accused the 12 times European Cup holders of ‘illegal and disrespectful behaviour’. <br>
</p>
<p>
Lionel Messi is due to make his PSG debut this weekend away to Reims and the feeling in the French capital is that it is in the interest of the Qatari-owned club to draw a line under Madrid’s pursuit of Mbappe so as not to overshadow Messi's first match.<br>
</p>
<p>
Al-Khelaifi’s response was an attempt to do that but Real Madrid director Emilio Butragueno, speaking at the Champions League draw, said the Spanish club was ‘calm and patient’ over its push to sign the 22-year-old forward.<br>
</p>
<p>
Madrid want Mbappe to make his debut on September 11 when Real Madrid return to the renovated Santiago Bernabeu in front of a reduced 40,000 capacity to face Celta Vigo.<br>
</p>
<p>
Despite the pandemic wiping 300m euros (£257m) off revenue since the pandemic, they say two frugal summers without a major signing have left them in a position to smash their transfer record for the French forward.<br>

<h2>
Manchester City players 'are excited at the prospect of playing alongside Cristiano Ronaldo' with Juventus talisman 'seen as the perfect fit as club's new No 9'... a day after Harry Kane's move to Etihad collapses</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/18/47139733-0-image-a-7_1629999283364.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Manchester City's players are reportedly excited about the chance to play alongside Cristiano Ronaldo after Portuguese talisman edged closer to joining the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 36-year-old's future at Juventus has been cast into doubt this summer and is now on the verge of signing for the Premier League champions, Portuguese reports suggest, after he agreed personal terms with City.<br>
</p>
<p>
And while there are still plenty of obstacles to overcome for the deal to go through, it hasn't stopped City's players from discussing the potential prospect of playing alongside the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, according to The Telegraph.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Telegraph are reporting that the talismanic forward has been 'the topic of conversation' during training on Thursday, asking Ronaldo's Portugal and former Juve team-mate Joao Cancelo how he trains and what work he does away from the training ground.<br>
</p>
<p>
The report goes on to add that the players believe his recent role as an orthodox No 9 will hugely benefit the team as much as Harry Kane would have, if his summer moved didn't collapse.<br>
</p>
<p>
The news that Ronaldo has been linked with City comes less than 24 hours after Kane's protracted move to City fell through, with the Tottenham striker pledging his immediate future to the club over social media. <br>
</p>
<p>
Reports in Italy earlier this week reported that City had offered the former Manchester United star a two-year deal worth £230,000 per week after missing out on Kane.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail also understands the ex-Real Madrid forward was offered to Guardiola's side in a £25million deal earlier this month. <br>
</p>
<p>
But with the conditions for Ronaldo's lucrative contract at City now believed to have been ironed out, it falls to City to negotiate a fee. This has threatened to prove a stumbling block, however, with the club said to be unwilling to splash out.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo is believed to currently earn in excess of £500,000 per week at the Allianz Stadium. He signed for Juventus in a mega-money move from Real Madrid in 2018, but now has less than 12 months remaining on his deal at the Serie A giants.<br>
</p>
<p>
The same report suggested that Guardiola reportedly rejected a proposal of a swap deal involving Gabriel Jesus, as City look to find a compromise.<br>
</p>
<p>
Soon, the Catalan boss and the Portugal star could finally represent the same club, with the former having spoken about his admiration for the player before.  <br>
</p>
<p>
'We don't have a single player who can win a game, we don't have a Cristiano, [Lionel] Messi, a Neymar,' Guardiola once said, highlighting Ronaldo first.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We don't have these types of players who can win games by themselves. I told the players many times, you have to play as a team.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I will be honest. I'd like to have a player to score, every single game, four goals and run like these players can run. I would love it.'<br>
</p>
<p>
And it's not the first time Ronaldo has been linked with City, either.<br>
</p>
<p>
In fact, the Portuguese forward refused to be drawn on whether he would join the club six years ago.<br>
</p>
<p>
An interview from 2015 has emerged where Ronaldo dodged questions on whether he could play for United's rivals one day, as he insisted that a move would not be based on the financial aspects.<br>
</p>
<p>
'You think the money is going to change my mind now?' he told the BBC in 2015. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I don't think so. I think it is not going to be the problem, because if you will speak about the money, I will go to Qatar.<br>
</p>
<p>
'[They] maybe have more money than Manchester City, but it's not about the money. It's about the passion.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Paris Saint-Germain were also sounded out as an option for Ronaldo but with Lionel Messi already in their ranks that potential switch has failed to gather any serious momentum.<br>
</p>
<p>
It's been reported that Ronaldo expressed his desire to exit after asking to be benched for their clash with Udinese last weekend. Massimiliano Allegri denied this while Juve vice-chairman Pavel Nedved doubled down on Allegri's bullish comments.<br>
</p>
<p>
 'We've decided together with Ronaldo. It's normal. Ronaldo will 100 per cent stay,' he told DAZN.<br>

The toast of Europe! Jorginho crowned UEFA's Player of the Year after winning the Champions League with Chelsea and helping Italy to Euro 2020 glory after an impressive 2020-21 season... as he beats N'Golo Kante and Kevin De Bruyne to gong</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/13/47128125-0-image-a-31_1629982366948.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Jorginho's brilliant summer has continued after he was crowned UEFA's Player of the Year following his double European triumph.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 29-year-old has enjoyed a brilliant few months - winning the Champions League final with Chelsea before mirroring those feats at international level as Italy became Euro 2020 champions.<br>
</p>
<p>
And on Thursday he completed a hat-trick of accolades as he was crowned UEFA's best player of last season.<br>
</p>
<p>
The midfielder beat Chelsea team-mate N'Golo Kante and Manchester City playmaker Kevin De Bruyne to the top prize.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea's No 5's big moment was officially announced during Thursday's Champions League group-stage draw.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jorginho said: 'I've very sorry I can't be there at his important moment due to the restrictions but I wanted to say that I'm very happy with this award.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I would like to say thank to you all the people who made their contribution to making this happen, a big thanks from the heart to all the people who helped me on this journey, from family to friends, to the supporters and my teammates and to people who didn't believe in me. <br>
</p>
<p>
'They motivated me to work even more so thanks to them as well. I've very happy, a hug to everybody.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Jorginho, Kante and De Bruyne had made the final three-man shortlist ahead of the likes of Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jorginho and Kante's partnership was a huge strength for Chelsea as they went on to lift the trophy against the odds after defeating Manchester City in last season's final in Porto. <br>
</p>
<p>
Lionel Messi - 4/11<br>
</p>
<p>
Robert Lewandowski - 6/1<br>
</p>
<p>
N'Golo Kante - 8/1<br>
</p>
<p>
Jorginho - 10/1<br>
</p>
<p>
Kylian Mbappe - 10/1<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
*Odds supplied by Betfair <br>
</p>
<p>
And the former's year got even better when two months later he won the European Championship with Italy after playing in every match. <br>
</p>
<p>
Being crowned UEFA's Player of the Year will boost his hopes of also claiming the prestigious Ballon d'Or.<br>
</p>
<p>
If it transpires that Jorginho is crowned the winner of that prize, he would become only the second player other than Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to win it since 2008 after Luka Modric scooped the award three years ago.<br>
</p>
<p>
As of Thursday afternoon, the Italy star is currently the joint-fifth favourite with the bookies to win the Ballon d'Or, behind Messi, Lewandowski and Kante, while alongside Kylian Mbappe.<br>
</p>
<p>
With Jorginho cementing his place among the best midfielders in the world in the last year, Chelsea are also said to be planning to reward him by tabling a new long-term contract.<br>
</p>
<p>
According to journalist Fabrizio Romano, Jorginho is one of several first-team players Chelsea want to tie down and club chiefs are expected to sit down with the player and his representatives in the coming weeks and months to propose a new contract. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Euro 2020 winner has already underlined his importance to Chelsea this term with strong displays in all three of their matches, helping the club to win the UEFA Super Cup and make a perfect start to the new Premier League season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Chelsea's Edouard Mendy was named goalkeeper of the year while Ruben Dias of Manchester City clinched the defender of the year prize.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jorginho's Chelsea team-mate N'Golo Kante won the midfielder of the year award and Borussia Dortmund starlet was named forward of the year.<br>
</p>
<p>
Thomas Tuchel was named manager of the year after steering Chelsea to European glory earlier this summer. <br>

<h2>
'He should push to leave': Dimitar Berbatov urges Donny van de Beek to seek Man United exit as former Red Devils forward says Dutchman unlikely to feature much this season and calls midfielder's saga 'really strange'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/18/47138657-0-image-a-22_1629997510467.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Donny van de Beek has been advised to look for a route out of Manchester United by Dimitar Berbatov.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Dutch midfielder is yet to play a minute of Premier League football this season and made only four starts in the top flight last season following a £35million move from Ajax.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Dutchman's continued absence from the team despite having barely any injury problems has long baffled United fans and Berbatov also admitted he was confused over how he has played so little for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side.<br>
</p>
<p>
And he does not see the situation improving for the 24-year-old, who could lose his place in the Dutch national side unless he starts playing regular football, with the next World Cup little more than a year away.<br>
</p>
<p>
 ‘I don’t think we’re going to see any more playing time from Donny van de Beek,' Berbatov, who spent four years at Old Trafford, said in his column for Betfair.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘It’s a really strange, disappointing and surprising situation. They spent around £35 million on him and, to pay that for a player who isn’t starting many games, doesn’t make sense.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘I think if he’s not happy, Van de Beek should push to leave. His place in the national team is at risk, especially now with Louis van Gaal in charge. Van Gaal is a disciplinarian who like his players to play football.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Van de Beek was part of Ajax's latest golden generation of players which took Europe by storm two years ago, winning a clean sweep of trophies in the Netherlands and reaching the Champions League semi-finals, knocking out Real Madrid and Juventus on the way to their agonising, last-minute elimination to Tottenham.<br>
</p>
<p>
Real Madrid were among the clubs to show interest in Van de Beek before United landed him and Berbatov has been frustrated to not see the player be given more of a chance to shine. <br>
</p>
<p>
‘I’m not blaming the player at all, but for me it’s one of the most disappointing transfers ever,' he added.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘He has got a lot of quality. I don’t like it when clubs buy for the sake of buying and this is one of those situations. I’m sure he’s banging on the manager’s door and asking questions.' <br>
</p>
<p>
‘Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes are untouchable in the United midfield at the moment. Scott McTominay, Fred and even 33-year-old Nemanja Matic are ahead of van de Beek.<br>
</p>
<p>
Berbatov had a trophy-laden spell with United after joining from Tottenham in 2008 but drifted out of the team in his last two seasons.<br>
</p>
<p>
He then switched to Fulham before heading to PAOK Salonika and has dark memories of his time in Greece, which means he can empathise with the midfielder.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘I know how Van de Beek feels,' Berbatov said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'In the late stage of my career I was playing in Greece, the president wanted me and signed me, but the coach didn’t want me and we had some issues. <br>
</p>
<p>
'It is frustrating for a player. He needs to have a long hard think about his situation and what he wants.’<br>

REVEALED: Cristiano Ronaldo dodged questions on whether he would one day join Man City six years ago by insisting he doesn't play for money... as that reality now moves closer amid reports Juventus star is edging towards deal with United's rivals</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/16/47135031-0-image-a-4_1629991667385.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Cristiano Ronaldo refused to be drawn on whether he could join Manchester City six years ago. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Juventus star has been heavily linked with a shock move to the Premier League champions and reports in Portugal on Thursday claimed the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has agreed personal terms with City.<br>
</p>
<p>
An interview from 2015 has emerged where Ronaldo dodged questions on whether he could play for Manchester United's rivals one day as that reality appears to edge closer. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 36-year-old insisted playing football was not about the financial gain when asked if he could be persuaded to make the move to the Etihad.<br>
</p>

'You think the money is going to change my mind now?' he told the BBC. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I don't think so. I think it is not going to be the problem, because if you will speak about the money, I will go to Qatar.<br>
</p>
<p>
'[They] maybe have more money than Manchester City, but it's not about the money. It's about the passion.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo scored 118 goals and supplied 69 assists in 292 appearances across a trophy-laden six-year spell at United between 2003 and 2009.<br>
</p>
<p>
Reports in Italy earlier this week reported that City had offered the former United star a two-year deal worth £230,000 per week after missing out on Tottenham striker Harry Kane.<br>

<h2>
Cristiano Ronaldo 'agrees personal terms with Manchester City - and has already spoken with Pep Guardiola', say reports in Portugal, with Juventus in talks over letting him leave</h2>

<p>
Cristiano Ronaldo has agreed personal terms ahead of a sensational move to Manchester City, according to reports in Portugal.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 36-year-old's future at Juventus has been cast into doubt this summer and his agent Jorge Mendes flew to meet the Serie A giants' bosses to discuss a resolution this week.<br>
</p>
<p>
But now reports in the Portugal international's home country suggest he has already spoken with City boss Pep Guardiola, and that the Italian side are now in talks with the Premier League champions about letting him leave three years after he joined.<br>
</p>
<p>
Following up on the crunch summit between Juventus and Mendes, further reports have described the talks as being fraught with tension. <br>

'I will be honest. I'd like to have a player to score, every single game, four goals and run like these players can run. I would love it.'<br>
</p>
<p>
If the recent ground-breaking reports are to be believed, then Guardiola looks to have finally secured this elusive final piece of the puzzle. <br>
</p>
<p>
Paris Saint-Germain were reportedly also sounded out as an option for Ronaldo, especially in light of their stunning summer business. But with Lionel Messi already in their ranks, that switch failed to get off the ground.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo made it clear to Juventus that he is angling for an exit over the coming days after asking to be benched for their clash with Udinese. Massimiliano Allegri denied this, but it is understood a departure is on the cards.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pavel Nedved, vice-chairman of the Old Lady, doubled down on Allegri's bullish comments, telling DAZN: 'We've decided together with Ronaldo. It's normal. Ronaldo will 100% stay. <br>
</p>
<p>
'It was a shared decision with the player. We have to start [the] season, [but] you can't be at the top. It's a decision for the good of the team. [Giorgio] Chiellini, a European champion, also starts from the bench today. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Will CR7 stay at Juventus? Absolutely yes.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Despite this standoffish nature, Ronaldo was also purportedly offered back to Real Madrid. This was quickly denied by Carlo Ancelotti and Ronaldo, though, with the player brushing off the talk in a 286-word social media post.  <br>
</p>
<p>
But with City now interested, he looks increasingly likely to finally secure his move. His new suitors turned their attentions to him after missing out on Harry Kane. <br>
</p>
<p>
City have already sent jaws dropping in this window, having secured Aston Villa and England playmaker Jack Grealish for a £100m fee, a British transfer record. Both Grealish and Kane were identified as their primary targets.<br>
</p>
<p>
They saw an opening bid of £75m plus £25m in add-ons rebuffed by Spurs and their chairman Daniel Levy, who has long since maintained that Kane was not for sale. City tried to test his resolve again, but Kane will stay in London.<br>
</p>
<p>
On Twitter, Kane said: 'It was incredible to see the reception from the Spurs fans on Sunday and to read some of the messages of support I've had in the last few weeks.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I will be staying at Tottenham this summer and will be 100% focused on helping the team achieve success. #COYS.'<br>
</p>
<p>
That, for now, leaves City with their current options of Gabriel Jesus, Ferran Torres and starlet Liam Delap as their only recognised No 9s.<br>

Matteo Guendouzi aims dig at Arsenal fans as he insists Marseille has the 'best atmosphere' that 'lifts the players' and says it's 'totally different' to the Emirates</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/14/47130263-0-image-a-49_1629985900340.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Matteo Guendouzi has aimed a dig at Arsenal fans by claiming Marseille have a better stadium atmosphere which is 'incomparable' to the Emirates.<br>
</p>
<p>
The midfielder left the Gunners to join the French side on loan in July but there is an obligation to buy clause for £10million included in the deal, meaning he is unlikely to return to north London.<br>
</p>
<p>
Guendouzi was frozen out by Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta after he was was overheard taunting Brighton players about their wages during a game in which he was also sent off towards the end of the 2019-2020 season.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 22-year-old was shipped out on loan to Hertha Berlin for the 2020-2021 campaign and found no way back into the Gunners' set-up when he returned.<br>
</p>
<p>
The midfielder appears to be happy with his new club and, when asked about the Marseille supporters, he aimed a small dig at his previous set of fans. <br>
</p>
<p>
'The Marseille fans are incomparable,' Guendouzi said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'At Arsenal, there’s a big stadium, but it’s totally different. The best atmosphere is here. It’s incredible to play in front of a crowd like this, it really lifts the players.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Guendouzi had penned an emotional message to Arsenal fans when he left the club earlier this summer, insisting he would be 'a Gooner forever'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Announcing his departure on his Instagram account, Guendouzi wrote: 'Thank you @Arsenal.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘Thanks for everything! I discovered and learned so much during my time here. It would be impossible to list everything without forgetting one memory or word…But I will never forget any minute spent with the Gunners jersey.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I will never forget the Emirates Stadium. I will never forget the fans. I won’t forget the city. I will never forget everything I’ve been through here. I will never forget that my only will was to defend with pride Arsenal colours.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘Thanks to all of those who believed in me during my time here, during the good and the bad moments. I can only wish the best to the club and its fan who deserve so much, trust me!‘Goodbye Arsenal, I will never forget you and will be a Gooner forever.' <br>
</p>
<p>
The midfielder was involved in controversy during Marseille's game against Nice, which saw a huge on-pitch brawl between Nice fans and members of the Marseille squad. Supporters had thrown a bottle at Marseille's Dimitri Payet, who then threw it back into the stands before fans stormed the pitch.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pictures emerged of the midfielder, which apperared to show marks on his neck, consistent with being strangled. But Guendouzi was accused of lying about his injuries by Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivere.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Apart from the photo that is everywhere, there has been no violence against OM players,' he told L'Equipe. 'By the way, Guendouzi, with pictures to prove it, has no marks on his neck when he is on the pitch.'<br>
</p>
<p>
But Marseille's director of communications, Jacques Cardoze, has hit back, and insisted that an independent doctor checked out Guendouzi's injuries.<br>
</p>
<p>
'There are cuts, we had an independent doctor in Marseille. There will be medical certificates,' he said. 'These are elements that will allow the investigation of the League and the disciplinary committee to be carried out.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Following the incident, the referee led both teams off the pitch and into the dressing rooms. Eighty minutes after the match was suspended, Nice said they wanted to restart, but Marseille refused owing to fears over safety.<br>

<h2>
Patrick Bamford is Gareth Southgate's surprise England call-up in his post-Euros squad but Mason Greenwood is left out by 'as the best thing for him', with Ben White and Ben Chilwell being dropped</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/14/47130609-0-image-a-74_1629985869613.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Leeds striker Patrick Bamford has earned his first senior England call up for the Three Lions' World Cup qualifiers against Hungary, Andorra and Poland next month.<br>
</p>
<p>
Gareth Southgate has made only a few alterations to the squad that suffered Euro 2020 heartbreak against Italy this summer, with Bamford a surprise addition.<br>
</p>
<p>
Manchester United striker Mason Greenwood, who has started the Premier League season in fine form with two goals in as many games, had to pull out of the Three Lions squad ahead of the tournament in June and has been left out of the 25-man squad this time around.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea left back Ben Chilwell, who has struggled for game time for both club and country in recent months, has been dropped by the England manager, while Liverpool right back Trent Alexander-Arnold has been recalled. <br>
</p>
<p>
The full back picked up a thigh injury which ended his hopes of playing any part for England at the rearranged tournament this summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ben White, fresh from his £50million transfer to Arsenal from Brighton following the Euros, has also been omitted due to illness, while Man United forward Marcus Rashford and Man City star Phil Foden sit out through injury. <br>
</p>
<p>
Southgate has welcomed back United midfielder Jesse Lingard, who was cut from the provisional Euros group, and Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope, who missed the tournament through injury.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The England boss was pleased to welcome Bamford into the squad, having worked with the Leeds forward during his time as manager of the Under 21s.<br>
</p>
<p>
He said: 'It's a fresh cycle and we would always pick the bulk of the squad from the summer. We are only two games into the season so we were never going to make big changes.<br>
</p>
<p>
Goalkeepers: Sam Johnstone, Jordan Pickford and Nick Pope<br>
</p>
<p>
Defenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Conor Coady, Reece James, Harry Maguire, Tyrone Mings, Luke Shaw, John Stones, Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker<br>
</p>
<p>
Midfielders: Jude Bellingham, Jordan Henderson, Jesse Lingard, Mason Mount, Kalvin Phillips and Declan Rice<br>
</p>
<p>
Forwards: Patrick Bamford, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Jack Grealish, Harry Kane, Bukayo Saka, Jadon Sancho and Raheem Sterling  <br>
</p>
<p>
'Ben White has Covid and Ben Chilwell has not played since the Champions League final.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford were injured so there was an opportunity in the forward areas. We were pleased with what Ollie (Watkins) did and now there is an opportunity for Patrick as a No 9.<br>
</p>
<p>
'His progress with Leeds has been excellent, he was very close at the end of last season. We worked with him at Under 21 level so we know him anyway and it is a special moment for his family.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The Three Lions will be looking to build on their run to the Euros final at Wembley where they came agonisingly close to winning a major tournament for the first time in 55 years.<br>
</p>
<p>
Southgate has taken England on an upward trajectory since taking charge, after reaching the semi-finals at the World Cup three years ago and the Road to Qatar continues on Thursday, September 2. <br>
</p>
<p>
England travel to Hungary next week, before hosting Andorra on Sunday, September 5 at Wembley and their World Cup triple-header concludes with a trip to Warsaw to face Poland.<br>
</p>
<p>
Southgate was glad to see England captain Harry Kane's immediate future resolved, with the forward confirming this week he would remain at Tottenham this summer on Wednesday.<br>
</p>
<p>
'In terms of Harry's situation, it is settled. It looks like he will be a Tottenham and that is obviously fantastic for Tottenham especially,' he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Harry got into the game at the weekend and I am expecting he will play a fair part tonight (against Pacos de Ferreira). The good thing from our point of view is it looks like everything is resolved and settled club wise.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He has got a clear focus now and I am sure he is looking forward to getting out on the pitch with Tottenham and then us next week.' <br>
</p>
<p>
On Greenwood's omission, Southgate added: 'I have spoken with him and with his club. He is a player we really like and we think he has every possibility to be a top England player.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We are all very conscious we make that progression at the right time. He is just breaking into the team at Manchester United with a lot of responsibility, that is a big thing for a young player to deal with.<br>
</p>
<p>
'And we want that progression with our seniors as best we possibly can so we get the best player at the end. We are all aligned on that - Mason, the club, his family and us.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We feel at the moment the best thing for him, after these first few games, is to stay at his club, but he is definitely a player we like. It is clear on his performances at the moment he would warrant being in the squad, absolutely.'<br>

'I'm burning his shirt': Manchester United fans vent over news that Cristiano Ronaldo has agreed personal terms with Manchester City</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/16/47130321-0-image-m-64_1629992307922.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Manchester United fans are far from pleased to hear that their former star Cristiano Ronaldo has agreed personal terms with Manchester City. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 36-year-old has reportedly spoken with Pep Guardiola and it is believed Juventus have entered into negotiations with the Premier League champions about letting Ronaldo leave. <br>
</p>
<p>
Manchester City fans are delighted with the news, while the Manchester United supporters have been left feeling 'angry', 'betrayed' and 'shocked' by the decision.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo started his professional career at Sporting Lisbon but developed into the world class players he is today at Manchester United. <br>
</p>
<p>
Sir Alex Ferguson saw Ronaldo's potential from an early age - buying him as largely unknown player for £12.24m in 2003. He worked closely with the striker developing his skills before handing him his debut against Bolton at Old Trafford. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo grabbed the attention of the fans with his stunning 30-minute performance - before going on to score eight goals in 39 appearances that season.  <br>
</p>
<p>
CR7 scored some stunning goals at Old Trafford during his career at the club and helped the Red Devils pick up several trophies before departing for Real Madrid in a deal worth £80m - making him the world's most expensive player.<br>
</p>
<p>
United fans always believed Ronaldo would return to Manchester, but they never believed it would be for Guardiola's side. <br>
</p>
<p>
As a result, they have taken to social media to vent their frustration. Many have described the move as the 'worst' thing that could happen to them. <br>
</p>
<p>
One supporter Tweeted saying: 'If Ronaldo does actually go to Man City words won't be able to describe how devastated I will be.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Another added: 'Ronaldo going to Man City is a gut punch. Doesn’t matter how many years since he left United. This isn’t on par with Figo going from Barca to Madrid, but it’s like Owen going from Liverpool to United.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Others took to Twitter to say that Ronaldo moving to City would actually 'break their hearts' and that such a move was 'unthinkable'. <br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, several fans demonstrated their anger by saying they would 'burn' their Ronaldo shirts if the Portuguese international joined the club over the road. <br>
</p>
<p>
Some even questioned Ronaldo's thought process behind the move, saying: 'Ronaldo can never play for Barcelona because of his relationship with Madrid. If he can play for city then he doesn't rate Man united and doesn't deserve the love from Manchester United supporters.' <br>
</p>
<p>
However, those who don't support United took to Twitter to write: 'Ronaldo ends up at Man City it’ll be hilarious on the basis that United fans have been treating him like he’s just nipped down the shop for bread & milk for the last 12 years.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Some took the opportunity to share hilarious memes about the situation, with one user making reference to Sir Alex Ferguson and another mocking Messi for thinking he could steal the headlines away from Ronaldo this summer. <br>

PSG 'plot potential moves for Erling Haaland, Paul Pogba and Eduardo Camavinga' in case Kylian Mbappe leaves for Real Madrid... despite sporting director Leonardo claiming the Ligue 1 side do NOT have a Plan B</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/13/47127205-0-image-a-5_1629980741318.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly targeting moves for Erling Haaland, Paul Pogba and Eduardo Camavinga as replacements for Kylian Mbappe, despite sporting director Leonardo claiming the French side do not have a Plan B in case he leaves.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Leonardo has insisted that club's stance on the Frenchman 'remains unchanged' despite Real Madrid appearing determined to snap up the PSG prodigy.<br>
</p>
<p>
The LaLiga giants saw their £137million opening bid rejected with the Parisians reportedly demanding £188m.<br>
</p>
<p>
If Real are successful in their pursuit to bring Mbappe to the Bernabeu this summer, three opportunities could arise for PSG to add to their star-studded squad.<br>
</p>
<p>
 Haaland, Pogba and Camavinga have all been touted by L'Equipe as targets to fill the potential void left by the 22-year-old.<br>
</p>
<p>
Borussia Dortmund phenomenon Haaland had been named as a prospect for Real if they failed to secure Mbappe's services this summer. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 21-year-old hitman had already held talks with the club through his agent, Mino Raiola, in April.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Los Blancos' potential Mbappe snatch this summer could see the Norwegian head to the French capital. <br>
</p>
<p>
Camavinga is one of Europe's hottest young prospects after his performances in Rennes' engine room last season and he has been linked with a move to some of Europe's top clubs - including Manchester United and Real Madrid. <br>
</p>
<p>
But both the Premier League and LaLiga giants have suffered a blow in their pursuit of Camavinga as PSG are closing in on a £25.7m move for the youngster, according to Ouest-France, as per L'Equipe. <br>
</p>
<p>
United were in the market for a midfielder amid speculation Pogba could be on his way to Paris and the Rennes midfielder had made the shortlist. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, with the 28-year-old looking likely to stay at Old Trafford - for this season at least - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's interest in Camavinga has cooled. <br>
</p>
<p>
PSG's potential signing of Camavinga could also impact their chase for the United star.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Parisians were reportedly willing to offer Pogba £510,000-a-week wages if he joins them for free next summer but that deal could be off the table if they bag Camavinga before deadline day. <br>
</p>
<p>
Leonardo has continuously refuted the prospect of Mbappe walking this summer, openly criticising Real's 'disrespectful' approach. <br>
</p>
<p>
 Leonardo was furious with Real's bid, with the fee lower than the sum they paid for the star when they signed him at age 18, and he accused the Spanish side of an illegal approach and a lack of respect.   <br>
</p>
<p>
When asked if the club was upset with Mbappe in an interview with Marca, L'Equipe, Le Parisien, the agency AFP and radio RMC, Leonardo said: 'We are not happy. But nothing and nobody is going to stop us from fulfilling our dream. There is a contract with a year left on it and an offer that is insufficient.<br>
</p>
<p>
'There is no Plan B. We have a very positive atmosphere at the club and everyone is excited about the project. We have never thought about a plan without Mbappe.'<br>
</p>
<p>
 'PSG's position has always been to keep Kylian. That's been the aim for the last two years and it remains unchanged,' he added.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We made him a big offer two months ago – at the level of the best players – and another even more recently which was even higher, but this is a strategy of Real Madrid, to have the name of one of our players.<br>
</p>
<p>
'For the last two years the behavior of Madrid has been incorrect, illegal, getting in contact with his representatives, unacceptable, completely incorrect towards us. And the proof of this strategy is to present an offer seven days before the market shuts and a year before the end of his contract. It seems like a strategy that suggests they have tried everything.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's not the sum [offered] which we believe to be a long way from what we were thinking. And we are not going to sell a player for less than we paid for him when he was 18. We have to give a certain amount to Monaco and the offer is not sufficient.'  <br>
</p>
<p>
Despite his adamant refusals that PSG are willing to relinquish their grip on Mbappe, Leonardo appeared to leave the door open for the World Cup winner to make the move to the Spanish capital if Madrid increase their offer. <br>
</p>
<p>
Not everything Leonardo said seemed to rule out Mbappe's departure this summer as he added: 'I have always said that he would not leave the club on a free. We have spoken with him a lot and with his family and representatives. <br>
</p>
<p>
'We have never opened the door to him [for him to leave]. If someone wants to go, we are not going to say no, but he will leave on our terms. We will see what happens.' <br>

<h2>
Rio Ferdinand calls talkSPORT trio Jim White, Simon Jordan and Trevor Sinclair 'CLOWNS' as he hits back at them for saying he 'overstepped the line' by calling Phil Jones a 'waste of time' at Manchester United and telling defender to move</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/12/47125913-0-image-a-2_1629977569490.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
The fallout from Rio Ferdinand's scathing comments about Phil Jones has continued with the former Manchester United main labelling a trio of talkSPORT stars 'clowns'.<br>
</p>
<p>
On Monday, Ferdinand ripped into United defender Jones, claiming the injury-plagued centre back is a 'waste of time' at Old Trafford and should 'find a new club'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ferdinand's former West Ham and England team-mate Trevor Sinclair was among those on talkSPORT to condemn his words on Wednesday, stating that he had 'overstepped the line'.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Ferdinand has fired back at Sinclair and his talkSPORT colleagues Jim White and Simon Jordan for discussing his views.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sports media outlet Three Sixty TV shared a clip of the talkSPORT trio discussing Ferdinand's remarks on Instagram, on which he left the comment: 'clowns'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jones has suffered a nightmare few years on the injury table and played for the first time in 19 months in a behind-closed doors friendly against Burnley earlier this month. The centre back has two years left on his deal from the four-year contract extension he signed in 2019. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ferdinand claimed the 29-year-old is taking an academy player's spot in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad and slammed the club and the defender for signing the new deal, with Sinclair claiming the ex-United defender went 'over the line' with his comments.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sinclair told TalkSPORT: 'Of course he (Jones) is going to accept (the new contract). He probably has aspirations of getting into the first team. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I look at Phil Jones I see a player that has been crippled with injuries over the years, all different kind of injuries as well.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I don't see a bad egg, I look at him, I think he looks like a good pro, he's not going to cause lots of problems, he's got a family, he's got kids, he needs to try and maximise the amount of finance he earns in his career.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Why would he turn down a contract of Mancheter United? I think the only people that need to be criticised are the people that offered him the contract because it has not worked out again.<br>
</p>
<p>
'For Rio to come out and criticise him and say he should leave the club and he's holding down an academy player's opportunity to go into the first team, I'm not happy with Rio about that, I think he stepped over the line for me.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Jones has two years left on his £130,000-a-week contract at Old Trafford and is keen to rebuild his United career. Despite spending most of his United spell on the treatment table, the Red Devils hierarchy offered Jones a four-year contract extension in 2019, which keeps him tied to Old Trafford until 2023.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, his chances of regaining a regular starting spot are slim after the £42million arrival of Raphael Varane from Real Madrid and Ferdinand has called time on his former team-mate's Old Trafford stay.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 42-year-old claimed Jones' exit was long overdue and believes the defender should have been offloaded before Chris Smalling left for Roma in 2019.  <br>
</p>
<p>
'He's taking up a youth team player's position in that squad right now,' Ferdinand told Vibe with FIVE. <br>
</p>
<p>
'He's had too many injuries… I was in the same team as Phil Jones, he came from Blackburn as a young kid, everyone was saying he was going to be this great player.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Huge potential but injuries have absolutely annihilated his career and then confidence issues at certain times as well.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He's never been able to fully establish himself in the team. Whether it's injuries, lack of form, lack of confidence. I think he should've gone ages ago. He should've gone before Chris Smalling went. Find a new club and play some football.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Ferdinand added: 'He's lacked consistency throughout his career at Man United. That's a fact, for all the reasons I stated before. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I am baffled at how he's still been given a new deal at the club given his past few years at the club. It just doesn't make sense to me how you get a new deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I remember back in the day you'd have to do some absolute graft to get a new deal. You'd have to be putting in performances, you'd have to be a vital member of the team. Phil Jones isn't that.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He's done well. Listen, good luck to him if you can get it. Staying at Man United is a great gig, but I look at him as a person, are you really going to be happy sitting there all these year?<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think [Danny] Drinkwater has been the same a little bit [at Chelsea]. It's quite easy to sit there a little bit, hide behind the curtains.<br>
</p>
<p>
'To be fair to Phil Jones, I've not seen him come out and speak and clarify, he might have had injuries we don't know about. But if he's been fit and has been sitting there like he has been, sign a new deal and stay and not go out on loan… that's not what a footballer wants to do.<br>
</p>
<p>
'There are players who are happy to just sit and clubs and not play and just chill. Winston Bogarde did it at Chelsea for about three or four years. Signed a big deal and commuted in from Holland.<br>
</p>
<p>
'If I was in the squad with someone like that I wouldn't talk to them. They are a waste of time, why would I chat to you and give you any energy, taking that away from my other team-mates who are here to play and go into battle for 90 minutes every week.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail revealed this month that United boss Solskjaer plans to use Jones as one of five centre backs following the signing of Varane.<br>

Mikel Arteta confirms Willian exit talks as he edges closer to a Brazil return with Corinthians just a year after joining Arsenal from Chelsea... and the Gunners boss hints at more signings despite already splashing out £129m</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/16/47135151-0-image-a-1_1629991836522.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has confirmed that Willian has held talks with Corinthians over a return to Brazil just 12 months after joining the Gunners.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the former Chelsea star was in talks to join the Brazilian side on a free transfer. <br>
</p>
<p>
Discussions were understood to be at an advanced stage with a willingness from all parties to complete a deal and now Arteta has confirmed the news.<br>
</p>
<p>
Willian was signed as a free agent last summer on a three-year deal but has experienced an unsuccessful spell at the Emirates. <br>
</p>
<p>
He made 37 appearances in all competitions last season, scoring just one goal and providing five assists.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal are expected to let the midfielder leave for free if a deal is agreed as they are keen to offload his £190,000-per-week salary from the wage books. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, Arteta insisted that the 33-year-old's future is not set in stone.  <br>
</p>
<p>
'We are having some conversations with him and the agent, and we are evaluating the position that we are in at the moment,' Arteta said. <br>

<p>
'I don't know [why it hasn't worked out for him here].<br>
</p>
<p>
'At the moment he is an Arsenal player, and we are trying to get the best out of him while he is here. Anything different is just things that can happen.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal are the biggest spenders of the Premier League in this transfer window, having splashed out £129million on Sambi Lokonga, Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Aaron Ramsdale and Nuno Tavares. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, the Gunners boss hasn't ruled out the possibility of more arrivals in north London before the transfer window shuts next week.   <br>
</p>
<p>
'We don't know [if we will make more signings],' he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We've already done a lot of things - ins and outs - I think it is 16 or 17 deals in total, with some renewals, which is a lot of things.<br>
</p>
<p>
'There are still some things to do in the last few days because there are still some questions marks and deals that can happen, but we will see.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal slipped to two successive defeats in the start to their 2021-22 Premier League campaign, making it their worst start to a season in their 118-year history. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, Arteta's men rallied to redeem themselves on Wednesday night as they mauled Championship side West Brom 6-0 in the second round of the Carabao Cup.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The Gunners face reigning champions Manchester City at the weekend as they look to secure their first league win of the season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Bukayo Saka picked up a knock in their thrashing of West Brom and Arteta confirmed that the 19-year-old would be checked over ahead of Saturday's trip to the Etihad.<br>

Brendan Rodgers hopeful Youri Tielemans will extend contract as Leicester look to tie down FA Cup final hero with £100,000-a-week deal amid interest from Liverpool</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/16/47136253-0-image-a-13_1629993401270.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers is hopeful that Youri Tielemans will sign a new contract with the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 24-year-old midfielder, the Foxes' player of the season and scorer of the winning goal in their FA Cup final success at Wembley, has been the subject of transfer speculation this summer with Liverpool reported to be among his admirers.<br>
</p>
<p>
The club would like to reward Tielemans for his performances with a new deal, while also strengthening their own position should a rival formally express an interest.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Belgium international has two years remaining on his existing contract, and Rodgers said: 'I hope we can have him for longer. Jon (Rudkin, director of football) is meeting with his representatives.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He is a top-class professional, a great guy and someone I love working with. He is very focused on his football and doesn't get sidetracked at all.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Leicester recently tied Harvey Barnes down to a new four-year deal and Tielemans is reported to be offered around £100,000 per week to sign his new contract. <br>
</p>
<p>
'As I have said before, I will give him everything to help him continuously improve and he will continue to give us everything too.<br>
</p>
<p>
'For me and Youri, it just continues - our relationship. Hopefully we can resolve something in the future.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Rodgers is also looking to add more signings to his squad ahead of Tuesday's transfer deadline.<br>
</p>
<p>
He said: 'There's nothing close at this moment, but we would still like to do one or two things. We don't have an endless pot of money. We may have to move one or two out first before anyone comes in.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But we have a brilliant group of players. When they are all fit, we have a squad that can challenge in every competition. I never want to complain about what we don't have.'<br>

Alashkert 0-0 Rangers (0-1 agg): Keeper Robby McCrorie gets KICKED IN THE HEAD but recovers to keep a clean sheet as the Scottish champions overcome Covid crisis to advance to Europa League group stages</h2>
<p>
Robby McCrorie, Europa League hero. Well ain’t that a kick in the head?<br>
</p>
<p>
On a sweltering night in Armenia, third-choice Rangers keeper McCrorie took a boot to the bonce from Brazilian brute James – red-carded for the second of two eminently bookable offences – but bounced back to keep a cool clean sheet.<br>
</p>
<p>
And that was enough, despite a seriously scrappy second half against ten men, to see Scotland’s underwhelming champions securely - if not remotely comfortably - into Friday’s group stage draw.<br>
</p>
<p>
Covid crisis averted, then. If Celtic’s analysts might not be terrified by anything they see while scouring replays of this performance by Rangers, well, there will be time enough to mull over the implications of that between now and Sundays’ meeting of Scottish football’s Big Two.<br>
</p>
<p>
All that mattered on Thursday night was getting through. And, in stifling conditions in the former Soviet republic, Steven Gerrard’s men – without their self-isolating manager and half a dozen members of the playing squad – ultimately had too much for their hosts.<br>
</p>
<p>
A bottom-of-the-bill contest boasting all the glamour associated with a 4pm kick-off on a night when four Scottish teams were in action, this still just about qualifies as a famous victory – on aggregate – recorded in arduous circumstances.<br>
</p>
<p>
The bare facts show that Gerrard only made four changes to the starting XI; not such a bad outcome, when you consider the scale of the Covid cluster that dominated the build-up to this one.<br>
</p>
<p>
But the specifics of one personnel switch, in particular, always felt like it might matter more than the headline number.<br>
</p>
<p>
The life of a third-choice goalkeeper is rarely glamorous. The most they can usually hope for is a steady diet of boredom and frustration - interrupted by moments of optimism and hope.<br>
</p>
<p>
McCrorie, having served his apprenticeships on loan at Queen of the South and Livingston, could never have expected his big break – a make or break, maybe – to come like this.<br>
</p>
<p>
In the absence of Allan McGregor and back-up goalie Jon McLaughlin, though, the 23-year-old would have been eager to seize his chance.<br>
</p>
<p>
Alashkert (4-3-3): Cancarevic 6; Kryuchkov 5, Voskanyan 5, Coelho Andrade 5, Boljevic 5; Khurtsidze 6, (Beko Fofana, 88) Hovsepyan 6 (Bezecourt, 45), Grigoryan 6 (Gome, 75); Glisic 5 (Tankov, 61), James 4 (sent off, 38), Embalo 6 (Aghekyan, 88).<br>

Rangers (4-3-3): McCrorie 7; Patterson 6, Goldson 6, Helander 6, Barisic 6; Arfield 7, Davis 7, Kamara 6; Aribo 7, Morelos 5, Hagi 6 (Itten, 64). <br>
</p>

</p>
<p>
Booked: Goldson, Barisic.<br>
</p>
<p>
Referee: Tobias Stieler (Germany)<br>
</p>
<p>
Talking of taking opportunities… Alfredo Morelos will wonder just how he blew two absolutely golden chances inside the opening half hour here.<br>
</p>
<p>
Just 11 minutes had elapsed when, thanks to the intense pressing of Scott Arfield and the lively Joe Aribo, the ball ricocheted ion the path of Morelos just 12 yards from goal.<br>
</p>
<p>
With only the keeper to beat, the Colombian striker blazed his right-footed effort high over the bar.<br>
</p>
<p>
Over in the away technical area, the on-duty coaching team of Gary McAllister and Michael Beale would have been as frustrated by the miss as they were encouraged by Alashkert’s laxness in trying to play out from the back.<br>
</p>
<p>
Three-and-a-half thousand miles away, an isolating Gerrard would surely have been shouting at the telly as Morelos squandered an even more clear-cut opportunity after 30 minutes of play.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sent through one-on-one by a deft Arfield pass, the in-demand striker rather ambled towards goal without any great conviction, then hit a mediocre shot that hit Alashkert keeper Ognjen Cancarevic in a particularly delicate spot.<br>
</p>
<p>
As irksome as those squandered openings might have been, Rangers were in control.<br>
</p>
<p>
True, young Nathan Patterson being dummied into diving in for the ball by James early on, leading to a dangerous break, would have been a concern.<br>
</p>
<p>
But the excellent Aribo had forced Cancarevic into a full-stretch save with a curling left-footed strike. Just one of several efforts in a dominant first half.<br>
</p>
<p>
And, of course, the odds tilted significantly in their favour thanks to not one, but two, moments of petty madness from James.<br>
</p>
<p>
With 36 minutes on the clock, he was booked for slamming the ball into the ground after a bit of Aribo brilliance had won a free-kick for Rangers.<br>
</p>
<p>
Barely two minutes later, he compounded his crime by clearly flicking out at the head of McCrorie as the goalie came out to gather a through ball.<br>
</p>
<p>
Never mind a second booking, the South American could easily have been shown a straight red by Bundesliga ref Tobias Stieler.<br>
</p>
<p>
McCrorie, mercifully, was OK to continue after treatment. At that moment, plenty would have offered much more than a penny for the thoughts of young Jay Hogarth – just 18 – as he contemplated the possibility of a rapid battlefield promotion.<br>
</p>
<p>
Now, we all know what happened when Rangers were handed a man advantage in their Champions League qualifier against Malmo.<br>
</p>
<p>
But surely now, a goal up against opponents insistent on playing out from the back despite being short of a body, the Scottish title holders would finish the job.<br>
</p>
<p>
The home side were duty-bound to at least have a go, of course. And things might have been different for them had Aleksandar Glisic put away a very good chance instead of heading over the bar from close range just minutes into the second half.<br>
</p>
<p>
How Jose Embalo completely failed to connect with a low cross from the left six yards out, meanwhile, may remain a mystery for some time; for a spell, the hosts looked capable of putting dangerous balls into the box with far too much ease.<br>
</p>
<p>
There were some seriously worrying moments right up until the final whistle, as a flattened Rangers – looking out on their feet and sitting far too deep – relied on desperate defending.<br>
</p>
<p>
They had chances themselves, though. None better than another one wasted by Morelos, who completed his hat-rick by blazing over the bar from Patterson’s superb cross.<br>
</p>
<p>
For once, the totemic striker wasn’t the main man, the game changer, the guy who made all the difference.<br>
</p>
<p>
In a game short on big moments, that honour surely goes to McCrorie. Mainly because he went mostly unnoticed.<br>
</p>
<p>
The rookie was solid and dependable, saving the efforts he should save – and picking up a battle scar that, for a day or two at least, he’ll wear as a badge of honour.<br>
</p>
<p>
Oh this? Yeah, I got kicked in the head. While playing in goal for Rangers in Armenia the other night. How did we get on? Well, let me tell you.<br>

<h2>
Au revoir, Olivier? France's second all-time top-scorer Giroud omitted from squad for upcoming 2022 World Cup qualifiers next month as boss Didier Deschamps chooses Anthony Martial instead insisting 'it's a sporting choice'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/18/47139997-0-image-m-43_1629999919318.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Olivier Giroud has been left out of the France squad for World Cup qualifiers against Bosnia, Ukraine and Finland as Les Bleus gear up for their first games since their early Euro 2020 exit.<br>
</p>
<p>
The striker, who joined AC Milan from Chelsea last month, makes way for Manchester United's Anthony Martial, who is back after missing the European Championship through injury.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I never had a radical position on any player. Olivier is still available, his situation has changed with his transfer to AC Milan where for now he has more playing time,' coach Didier Deschamps told a news conference on Thursday.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's a sporting choice of the moment in a competitive environment with the return of Anthony Martial.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Deschamps said it did not mean Giroud's international career was over.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It doesn't mean anything for the future. It's my choice today. It's up to Olivier to continue to perform. He is eligible.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Giroud, 34, is France's all-time second-top scorer with 46 goals from 110 games.<br>
</p>
<p>
Deschamps named four newcomers in his 23-man squad in Bayer Leverkusen striker Diaby, Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni, AC Milan full-back Theo Hernandez and Roma midfielder Jordan Veretout.<br>
</p>
<p>
World champions France, who were knocked out by Switzerland in the last 16 at this year's Euros, take on Bosnia in Strasbourg on Wednesday before travelling to Ukraine three days later and hosting Finland in Lyon on September 7.<br>
</p>
<p>
Also featuring in the squad is Kylian Mbappe, who has yet to extend his contract with Paris Saint-Germain and has been the subject of a failed £137million bid from Real Madrid. <br>
</p>
<p>
'The transfer window closes on Tuesday night on the eve of a game, which is not ideal but there's nothing I can do about it,' said Deschamps.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Kylian might change clubs and I will do my best to be understanding as it's the players' future that could be decided.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I can give him advice but the decision is theirs.'<br>

<h2>
Harry Kane 'wants Tottenham to pay him £400,000-A-WEEK after giving up on a dream move to Man City' as the striker looks to become the Premier League's top earner</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/14/47130877-0-image-a-25_1629986243414.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Harry Kane is reportedly set to ask Tottenham for wages of £400,000-a-week after failing to land a move to Manchester City this summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday that Kane would be staying at Spurs this season before the striker confirmed the news on his social media accounts.<br>
</p>
<p>
According to The Times, Kane has accepted City will not pay the £150million fee set by Daniel Levy but is seeking a wage to reflect the club's valuation and one which would make him the Premier League's highest paid player.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is the top flight's top earner with a salary of £385,000-a-week, while Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea is second with £375,000-a-week wages.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane is thought to have been given a pay rise when Spurs refused to sell him last summer, with the striker's current deal said to be worth £300,000-a-week.<br>
</p>
<p>
According to the report, Spurs would be likely to hand the 28-year-old a rise only if it were heavily linked to bonuses, including goals. <br>
</p>
<p>
1 - Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City) - £385,000 p/w<br>
</p>
<p>
2 - David De Gea (Manchester United) - £375,000 p/w  <br>
</p>
<p>
3 = Paul Pogba (Manchester United) - £300,000 p/w<br>
</p>
<p>
3 = Raheem Sterling (Manchester City) - £300,000 p/w<br>
</p>
<p>
3 = Harry Kane (Tottenham) - £300,000 p/w <br>
</p>
<p>
6 - Timo Werner (Chelsea) - £270,000 p/w <br>
</p>
<p>
7 - Anthony Martial (Manchester United) - £250,000 p/w <br>
</p>
<p>
7 =  Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) - £250,000 p/w <br>
</p>
<p>
9 - Willian (Arsenal) - £220,000 p/w <br>
</p>
<p>
10 = Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) - £200,000 p/w   <br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane insisted he would be focused on having a good season with Spurs, despite believing he had been on the receiving end of broken promises by the club. <br>
</p>
<p>
He wrote on Twitter: 'It was incredible to see the reception from the Spurs fans on Sunday and to read some of the messages of support I've had in the last few weeks.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I will be staying at Tottenham this summer and will be 100% focused on helping the team achieve success.'<br>
</p>
<p>
As revealed by Sportsmail last week, sources close to the England captain insisted he will continue to give everything to Spurs, despite feeling that the club have not matched his ambitions.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane's camp claim it was agreed he would be permitted to leave if Spurs didn't win a trophy or qualify for the Champions League last season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tottenham manager Nuno Espirito Santo expressed his delight at Kane's news stating later on Wednesday: 'Great news, great news. Fantastic news for everybody. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Since Harry joined us, he has been working so this is what we value. His attitude in training session has been great... so it is finished.'<br>
</p>
<p>
As Sportsmail reported, Kane's desire to leave for the Etihad had nothing to do with money — although sources on Wednesday indicated that his wages at Manchester City could have reached as much as £500,000 a week all in. <br>
</p>
<p>
After failing to sign Kane this summer, Man City are reportedly eyeing a move for Cristiano Ronaldo.<br>
</p>
<p>
According to Gianlucadimarzio.com, City are willing to offer Ronaldo a two-year deal worth over £230,000-a-week but do not want to pay Juventus a transfer fee for the Portuguese icon.<br>
</p>
<p>
The report says the Old Lady want around £25million for the player which would allow them to find a replacement so late in the window.<br>
</p>
<p>
Juventus reportedly like the idea of taking on City's Brazilian striker Jesus in a swap, but Guardiola is said to have rebuffed that idea.<br>
</p>
<p>
City's manager has also confirmed he will leave the club at the end of the 2022-2023 season, with his next role set to be in international football. <br>
</p>

<h2>
West Ham 'finally agree personal terms with Kurt Zouma as defender undergoes a medical in Paris' ahead of £25m move from Chelsea... and he'll become club's highest earner on £125,000-a-week deal </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/07/47118635-0-image-a-48_1629961159625.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
West Ham expect to complete the signing of Kurt Zouma from Chelsea once his medical is completed on Friday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Despite a hitch in negotiations early on Wednesday, obstacles were overcome for all parties to reach an agreement over a £26million transfer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Zouma is in Paris on compassionate leave and began the first stage of his medical on Thursday but it will not be completed until Friday. He would need to be registered on Friday to be in contention to face Crystal Palace at the weekend. <br>
</p>
<p>
Attempts to sign Zouma were in doubt after negotiations with intermediaries ran into difficulties on Wednesday night, but those issues have now been resolved and a five year contract is in place.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail previously revealed that Zouma wanted a £125,000-a-week contract. <br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea have now brought in over £100m in player sales this summer. They allowed Zouma to leave as they want to make space in their squad for Sevilla's Jules Koundé, who is regarded as one of the best centre-backs in Europe while they are continuing talks with Atletico Madrid over a loan with option deal for midfielder Saul Niguez.<br>
</p>
<p>
West Ham are top of the Premier League after the opening two fixtures and manager David Moyes wanted to bolster his defence to continue the momentum he has created at the London Stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
Moyes had considered a number of targets including Fiorentina's Nikola Milenkovic while Zouma was initially reluctant about the move.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, West Ham plan to finalise details over the next 24 hours then look at other targets before the window closes next week.<br>
</p>
<p>
Their remaining budget is understood to be limited as Moyes looks to add Nikola Vlasic from CSKA Moscow and potentially a couple of loans also. A deal for Manchester United's Jesse Lingard is still considered unlikely at this stage.<br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Chelsea have agreed to send Tiemoue Bakayoko on loan to AC Milan for an initial £428,000 fee with an option to make the sale permanent for £17.2m.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 27-year-old will sign a new two year contract extension with Chelsea first.<br>

Mikel Arteta says Arsenal can change the 'narrative' of their season if they are able to get a shock win against  Manchester City after making their worst start to a Premier League campaign in the club's history</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/13/47127353-0-image-m-36_1629981220463.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Mikel Arteta says Arsenal have the chance to change the perception of their start to the season when they travel to champions Manchester City on Saturday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal have lost both of their first two Premier League games, against Brentford and Chelsea, without scoring.<br>
</p>
<p>
They ended their winless and goalless start to the season with a 6-0 EFL Cup thumping of Championship West Brom last night but Arteta believes their trip to the Etihad represents a real opportunity to lift the mood.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘It can be great,’ he said. ‘It would be a massive lift to go up to Manchester, against the champions and get the win.<br>
</p>
<p>
It will change the narrative a lot. It will help us in the table for sure because we need the points.’<br>
</p>
<p>
Arteta spent three years at City as assistant to Pep Guardiola and, given the scrutiny on him and Arsenal, his answer when asked what the most valuable thing he learned from his time at the Etihad was especially significant.<br>
</p>
<p>
He said: ‘First of all you have to believe in what you do and in any difficult moment you stick to what you do. The whole team, the whole club ethics are what we believe in and all decisions are made all the time in that direction.’<br>
</p>
<p>
Arteta also confirmed that Bukayo Saka is one player Arsenal are assessing after he was hurt following a late tackle against West Brom.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘He [Saka] was limping after the match. We will see today how that knee reacts. He had a knock yes. ‘We have one or two doubts from the previous game [Chelsea] as well. We will know more tomorrow when we all train together. He [Saka] was limping after the match. We will see today how that knee reacts. He had a knock yes.’<br>

<p>
Despite weighing up whether to retire from playing due to a lack of offers, Wilshere insisted he still has 'hunger' to play on and find a new club - and he could now have an option in the north west.<br>
</p>
<p>
The former Arsenal golden boy has seen his career decimated by injuries and is currently without a club at the age of just 29.<br>
</p>
<p>
His most recent spell in the game came with Bournemouth last year in the Championship, but the Cherries chose not to renew his contract at the end of last season. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, Wilshere's fortunes could be about to change - if he's willing to make the move to League One.<br>
</p>
<p>
On Wednesday night, Wigan chairman Talal Al Hammad tweeted Wilshere to offer him a chance to join the squad. <br>
</p>
<p>
'You are most welcome to join us @LaticsOfficial,' the Al Hammad wrote, adding the hashtag #Believe.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The offer came after Wilshere told The Athletic of his desperation to be involved this season, and described the feeling of being made to watch on from home.<br>
</p>
<p>
'What I would say is I still have that hunger in me, somewhere deep in me, that all I want to do is play football,' Wilshere said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I don't want people to think, "Oh look, poor Jack, he hasn’t got a club, (but) he’s made loads of money out of football, he gets to stay home with his kids".<br>
</p>
<p>
'When I wake up in the morning I want to look forward to going to training and being with the lads. I want to get back out on the pitch, especially with the fans now back. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I’ve watched every single game that’s been on TV since the start of the season and I want to be part of that.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I want that feeling of going out on the pitch, hearing the fans and just being able to play football again.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Wilshere also painfully recalled a moment where his son, Archie, aged nine, asked him why no clubs are interested in him. <br>
</p>
<p>
'My kids are at an age where they understand,' Wilshere added. 'Especially Archie, who's nine. He's actually having conversations with me, saying, "What about the MLS?" or "Why aren't you playing in La Liga?"<br>
</p>
<p>
'He loves football. He knows everything about football. And it is difficult to explain to him. He'll say to me, "How come no club wants you?" I don't know. But how do I explain that to him?'<br>
</p>
<p>
He dazzled during Arsenal's victory over Barcelona in the Champions League in 2012, and when fit often starred during a decade at the club. He also has 34 England caps to his name.<br>
</p>
<p>
But severe and persistent injuries, including serious ankle problems and a broken leg, have derailed his career and he finds himself unemployed after a two-year stint at West Ham and a short spell on the south coast.<br>
</p>
<p>
Wilshere is yet to respond to the offer from Wigan, with a switch to the third tier a far cry from his days in the Premier League with Arsenal and West Ham.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Latics, who were relegated from the top-flight in 2013, have yo-yoed between the Championship and League One in recent years, and currently find themselves ninth in the table.<br>
</p>
<p>
After losing their opening game of the season against Sunderland, Leam Richardson and his players have bounced back with wins over Rotherham and Charlton, and a draw with Wycombe. <br>

<h2>
The battle over Ronaldo: Super-agent Jorge Mendes heads for Juventus HQ, with his club 'wanting £24m to sell but Man City having NO intention to pay a fee' after Cristiano, 36, was left out against Udinese to consider his future </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/11/47124243-0-image-a-5_1629974136685.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Jorge Mendes has flown to Turin for showdown talks with Juventus over Cristiano Ronaldo's future at the club, according to reports.<br>
</p>
<p>
Reports in Italy on Wednesday claimed Manchester City have offered the Portugal star a two-year contract worth £230,000 per week. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, Sportsmail understands a move for Ronaldo from the Premier League champions remains unlikely despite being offered to the club for £25million.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 36-year-old has never been part of Pep Guardiola's plans, with the club now likely to go with what they have got after missing out on Tottenham and England striker Harry Kane.<br>
</p>
<p>
Goal however are now reporting that super-agent Mendes is searching for some clarity regarding Ronaldo's future and will hold talks with Juventus bosses, with the aim of seeking a resolution of some sort between the two parties. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo signed for Juventus in a mega-money move from Real Madrid in 2018, but now has less than 12 months remaining on his deal at the Serie A giants which sees him rake in more than £500,000 per week.<br>
</p>
<p>
The reports in Italy earlier this week also claimed City do not want to pay Juventus a transfer fee for the Portuguese icon, while Guardiola is said to have rebuffed the idea of Gabriel Jesus moving to Italy in a swap deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
But while a move to City appears increasingly unlikely, reports across Europe have suggested the former Manchester United star is looking for a new challenge.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo started on the bench - according to some, due to his own request - in Juventus' season opener against Udinese, raising further speculation about his future.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Portuguese forward did, however, come on and score what would have been the winner, only for it to be chalked off by VAR.<br>
</p>
<p>
Paris Saint-Germain remain interested in Ronaldo as well, with the French giants struggling to keep Kylian Mbappe, who was the subject of a £137m bid from Real Madrid this week. <br>
</p>
<p>
Such a move would also mean the tantalising prospect of Ronaldo lining up alongside Lionel Messi. <br>
</p>
<p>
City have already spent big in this window after securing Aston Villa and England midfielder Jack Grealish for a British record £100m fee.<br>
</p>
<p>
The champions had also earmarked a striker as a priority this window and wanted to add Kane, but saw an opening bid of £75m plus £25m in add-ons rejected by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, who maintained Kane was not for sale.<br>
</p>
<p>
City tried to test Tottenham's resolve by launching a bid closer to Levy's £150m valuation for the striker but Kane has now revealed his intention to stay at Spurs.<br>
</p>
<p>
Taking to Twitter on Wednesday afternoon, the 28-year-old said: 'It was incredible to see the reception from the Spurs fans on Sunday and to read some of the messages of support I've had in the last few weeks.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I will be staying at Tottenham this summer and will be 100% focused on helping the team achieve success. #COYS.'<br>
</p>
<p>
It now leaves City with their current options of Gabriel Jesus, Ferran Torres and prodigious youngster Liam Delap as recognised strikers, while Phil Foden, Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling can all operate through the middle.<br>

<h2>
Travelling fans face being BANNED from their teams' Champions League group stage away matches, with supporters in limbo over whether UEFA will allow them in due to a long-running block still standing, just hours before today's draw</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/07/47118075-0-image-a-4_1629961009608.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Pressure is increasing on UEFA to allow away supporters to attend fixtures in club competitions this season by removing the blanket ban.<br>
</p>
<p>
Manchester United and Ajax have urged the governing body to reconsider, after travelling fans were not able to watch games in the qualifying stages of the Champions League, Europa League and the Europa Conference League.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail understands that a decision is yet to be made on whether they will be permitted at fixtures starting from next month, but calls for the ban to finally be dropped are continuing to grow.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The group Football Supporters Europe (FSE) have released a statement urging UEFA to drop the restriction - which was brought in to help limit the spread of Covid-19 - and instead work on a case-by-case basis, and have even accused the exclusion of being 'unequal treatment'. <br>
</p>
<p>
In June, the decision was taken by the UEFA Executive Committee to put a stop to away supporters being admitted into matches for the entirety of the qualifying and play-off phases for their three flagship tournaments.<br>
</p>
<p>
Indeed, despite the importance of the qualifiers, which were held over two legs unlike last season, the ban was kept for visiting spectators. Now, they are currently left in limbo with the group fixtures to be revealed soon.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The next steps of UEFA's decision-making will take into account the state of the Covid-19 pandemic across Europe, and it is understood that there has been no timeframe placed on when a final answer is expected.<br>
</p>
<p>
This comes despite there being an initial hope that the announcement would be made ahead of the Champions League draw, which takes place this evening. The Europa League draw, meanwhile, will be held tomorrow.<br>
</p>
<p>
Revealing the decision had been taken to ban away supporters, the UEFA Executive Committee said it was 'prudent' to propose that fans would not be allowed. They added that the 'very high number of matches' weighed in on the move.<br>
</p>
<p>
'With this decision UEFA intends to act responsibly at a time where restrictive measures are still in place in order to avoid the spread of infections,' the statement added, while also highlighting that 'sporting fairness' was 'preserved'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Every affected club had been informed about the directive from UEFA ahead of the draws being revealed for their qualifying ties. <br>
</p>
<p>
The same ban applies for next month's international fixtures, too, with UEFA and FIFA confirming the crackdown as a result of a 'spike' in coronavirus cases. In a letter sent to national associations, they said the decision was taken for 'safety'.<br>
</p>
<p>
This is expected to be reviewed ahead of the matches in October and November, but travelling England supporters will not be able to watch their World Cup qualifiers in Poland and Hungary. The FA will not be receiving any tickets. <br>
</p>
<p>
In a statement, FSE say they are 'opposed' to the blanket ban for both club and national team competition games, and also insist that away spectators 'should not be subject to specific exclusions'. <br>
</p>
<p>
They have referenced the comments of Ajax CEO Edwin van der Sar, who said: 'Football is for the fans - of both clubs. <br>
</p>
<p>
'In my conversations at the draw in Istanbul, I will emphasise how important we think it is for our fans to be able to attend away games - in a responsible way, of course.'  <br>
</p>
<p>
'As things stand, however, a group of Dutch fans, for example, can visit France, go to a cinema, music festival, and sporting event together, but still be barred from attending their own club's match in a stadium that is filled with home fans,' FSE add.<br>
</p>
<p>
'FSE therefore believes that guidelines on away fans should be decided on a case-by-case basis in line with the local public health situation and advice of the relevant public authorities - which the overwhelming majority of fans have respected throughout the pandemic and fully understand are liable to change.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We have communicated this position to UEFA and asked for a timely re-evaluation of its existing policy before the fixture list is announced so that fans have ample opportunity to make any travel-related decisions.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Tottenham's official supporters' trust have revealed they are behind FSE's argument, and have also contacted the club over the issue.<br>
</p>
<p>
'#THST endorses @FansEurope’s position on away fans at UEFA club competitions and has lobbied #Spurs to support the lifting of a blanket ban,' a tweet read.<br>
</p>
<p>
But with the Champions League group stage fixtures set to be released after the draw, FSE's call will fall on deaf ears. They called for a similar move last month ahead of qualifying ties, describing the ban as leading to 'increasingly absurd outcomes'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The dilemma over travelling across the globe this season in light of the pandemic has also sparked a new club versus country row. Premier League clubs have united in refusing to let their players travel to 'red list' countries.<br>
</p>
<p>
Each of the international stars touching down in a country on the list would have been forced to undertake a mandatory 10-day quarantine period when back in the UK, meaning they would have missed several matches.<br>
</p>
<p>
Top-flight chiefs lobbied the government for exemptions to the restrictions and, as recently reported by Sportsmail, they met with senior figures at the Department of Media, Culture and Sport to plead their case. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, Sportsmail understands that the exemptions will not be granted with the government holding firm. They were mindful that giving the green light would have led to accusations of double standards.<br>
</p>
<p>
FIFA president Gianni Infantino has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to request exemptions, but no U-turn is expected.  <br>

<h2>
Lautaro, Trippier, Kounde, Camavinga... and so much more! As the transfer window enters its final nail-biting week, here are the deals EVERY Premier League team are looking to get over the line</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/11/47124873-0-image-a-10_1629975419263.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
With just under a week remaining in the summer transfer window, Premier League clubs are entering the make-or-break period for getting deals done.<br>
</p>
<p>
The transfer window always roars into life in the final days, as clubs each take the opportunity to slide last minute offers across the table in hope of panicking their rivals into selling up. <br>
</p>
<p>
This summer will be no different and, with now just days left to go, the frantic late shopping is set to begin.<br>
</p>
<p>
Despite many sides still struggling from the financial effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the cash is very much being splashed and there could still yet be hands shaken on record-breaking transfers.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail takes a close look at every Premier League side, which positions they need reinforcing and the players they are chasing as the deadline of 11pm on Tuesday August 31 looms large. <br>
</p>
<p>
The biggest spenders of the window so far, yet have started the season with two defeats from two. Certainly not what Mikel Arteta was wanting, and the pressure is firmly on.<br>
</p>
<p>
Some positions have been filled for the Gunners with the likes of Ben White and Martin Odegaard arriving, but another attacking outlet is needed along with wide reinforcements at the back. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Striker, right-back<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Kieran Trippier (Atletico Madrid), Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan), Andrea Belotti (Torino)<br>
</p>
<p>
Flush with cash from the £100million Jack Grealish sale, Villa have already invested huge sums back into their playing squad. <br>
</p>
<p>
A return to the transfer market is possible though, if the right deal surfaces.<br>
</p>
<p>
They will miss out on Thomas Delaney, however, as the Dane is all set to join Sevilla. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Midfielder, winger<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Thomas Delaney (Borussia Dortmund), Cheick Doucoure (Lens), Weston McKennie (Juventus), Todd Cantwell (Norwich), Abdou Harroui (Sparta Rotterdam), Dwight McNeil (Burnley)<br>
</p>
<p>
The new boys have started off brightly in Premier League life, though will look to add further personnel if the option presents itself.<br>
</p>
<p>
Positions in various holes across the pitch need filling for the Bees, or at the very least reinforcing. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Striker, right wing-back, midfielder<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Brennan Johnson (Nottingham Forest), Jens Cajuste (FC Midtjylland)<br>
</p>
<p>
Graham Potter is sticking by his mantra of bringing in players who have the ability to play confidently and carefully in possession.<br>
</p>
<p>
He wants the Seagulls to develop their brand of aesthetically pleasing football, while retaining their place in the top flight.<br>
</p>
<p>
Eyeing talents from Spain and Portugal gives an indication of the direction the club is looking to head. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Striker, left-back<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Marc Cucurella (Getafe), Darwin Sanchez (Benfica)<br>
</p>
<p>
Sean Dyche's men are seen to have been pushing their luck in the Premier League for the last three or four seasons.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Clarets are not fondly regarded for their aggressive and direct style of play, though it has retained their status in the English top flight nonetheless.<br>
</p>
<p>
Players from various corners of the Continent are being eyed up by Dyche, who will be keen to get at least one sizeable signing on board before the window slams shut. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Left-back, centre back, midfielder<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Maxwel Cornet (Lyon), Jack Hendry (Oostende), Will Hughes (Watford), Ryan Christie (Celtic), Marcus Tavernier (M'Boro)<br>
</p>
<p>
It comes as little surprise that Chelsea have not shown signs of feeling the financial bite of the coronavirus pandemic.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Blues remain as wealthy as ever under Roman Abramovich, and showcased this by splurging a club record £97m to bring back their own former player Romelu Lukaku.<br>
</p>
<p>
Thomas Tuchel remains keen on strengthening his defence, and hopes remain that Sevilla will soon play ball regarding Jules Kounde - and it is reported that the clubs are close to agreeing a €50million (£42.7m) deal. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Centre-back, midfielder<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Jules Kounde (Sevilla), Saul Niguez (Atletico Madrid), Aurelien Tchouameni (Monaco)<br>
</p>
<p>
After spending the summer cutting adrift old-timers and reducing both the average age of the squad and its wage bill, Palace need to inject fresh faces.<br>
</p>
<p>
New boss Patrick Vieira has been tasked with bringing in youthful stars, who also already know their way around the Premier League. It's no easy task.<br>
</p>
<p>
Interest in Arsenal's Eddie Nketiah is expected to intensify greatly in the final days. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Two forwards, centre-midfielder<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Eddie Nketiah, Reiss Nelson (both Arsenal), Ademola Lookman (RB Leipzig), Will Hughes (Watford), Lewis O'Brien (Huddersfield)<br>
</p>
<p>
Rafa Benitez is cost cutting in his first window as Goodison boss, though this hasn't stopped him bringing some important names on board.<br>
</p>
<p>
The club find themselves wanting in various departments, and will be forced into the transfer market if James Rodriguez seals a late exit from Merseyside as he intends to. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Striker, winger, centre-midfielder, centre-back, right-back<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Daniel Jebbison (Sheff Utd), Dwight McNeil (Burnley), Salomon Rondon (Dalian), Malang Sarr (Chelsea), Matheus Nunes (Sporting), Nathan Patterson (Rangers)<br>
</p>
<p>
Marcelo Bielsa will remain rigid in his principles and will only be looking to bring in players who he believes are either already accustomed to, or can be moulded into, his famed style of high-intensity play.<br>
</p>
<p>
With Leo Hjelde's move from Celtic tied up, advanced positions are now the most pressing issue for the Yorkshire club. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Winger, midfielder<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Leo Hjelde (Celtic), Ryan Kent (Rangers), Noa Lang (Club Brugge), Lewis O'Brien (Huddersfield)<br>
</p>
<p>
Concerns are still very much etched across the defence following the horror injury to Wesley Fofana, and not for the first time Burnley rock James Tarkowski is firmly in Brendan Rodgers' sights.<br>
</p>
<p>
The board will back the Northern Irishman, who is looking to build upon last season's success of lifting the FA Cup, in the market. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Centre-back, forward, winger<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: James Tarkowski (Burnley), Odsonne Edouard (Celtic), Ademola Lookman (RB Leipzig)<br>
</p>
<p>
Jurgen Klopp has made clear that this summer will not be one of rich spending for his side.<br>
</p>
<p>
The priority at Anfield is the renewing of big contracts for irreplaceable stars, hence the likes of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho, Virgil van Dijk, Alisson and Andy Robertson each committing their futures.<br>
</p>
<p>
Captain Jordan Henderson will soon follow, while the Reds are set to pull out all of the stops for Mohamed Salah. Lingering concerns remain in the goalkeeping department and players are being monitored, but barring late injuries Liverpool are now putting off all deals until next year. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Goalkeeper, midfielder<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: David Marshall (Derby), Mikkel Damsgaard (Sampdoria)<br>
</p>
<p>
Pep Guardiola has wanted an addition at left-back all summer and various European youngsters have been considered, but this is likely a position that will be left unfilled for now.<br>
</p>
<p>
Of course, it is no secret that City are desperate for an out-and-out striker. Sergio Aguero has left and Guardiola does not trust Gabriel Jesus as a No 9.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Spanish manager went as a far to publicly confirm that the club had decided on the league's most revered marksman, Harry Kane, but after Tottenham held firm and City did not push enough, Kane has admitted defeat and announced he will stay at Spurs. <br>
</p>
<p>
That probably means £100m Jack Grealish will be their only big-money signing this summer, unless they u-turn and take up the offer from Jorge Mendes to sign Cristiano Ronaldo for £25m. It is reported in Italy that City are willing to offer Ronaldo a two-year deal worth over £230,000-a-week but do not want to pay Juventus a transfer fee - but Sportsmail understands that City are not interested.<br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Left-back, striker<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Harry Kane (Tottenham)<br>
</p>
<p>
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is very much still in the market and a late deal is not out of the question, despite a £115m outlay on Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane. <br>
</p>
<p>
United have a much greater spine and solidity compared to last season, though the final week of the window could see the Red Devils on the phone to the Spanish capital quite a lot, with central midfield still the most pressing issue.<br>
</p>
<p>
Saul Niguez has been a long-term target but United are now battling Chelsea for his signature, and a loan to the latter could be more likely. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Right-back, midfielder, striker<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Kieran Trippier (Atletico Madrid), Eduardo Camavinga (Rennes), Saul Niguez (Atletico Madrid)<br>
</p>
<p>
Not the most glamorous names being eyed up by the Canaries, but Daniel Farke needs plenty of reinforcements in place if his side are to do what they failed to do last time: stay up.<br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Goalkeeper, midfielder, striker<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Christian Walton (Brighton), Matthias Normann (Rostov), Mbaye Niang (Rennes)<br>
</p>
<p>
Funds are limited as ever on Tyneside but Steve Bruce still wants to plug gaps in his squad. The final week of the window could be crucial in securing cut-price agreements, or shaking hands on a loan or two. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Centre-back, midfielder<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Hamza Choudhury (Leicester, loan), Oliver Skipp (Tottenham, loan), Santiago Munoz (Santos Laguna)<br>
</p>
<p>
The Saints have cleared out some names and recouped transfer fees, while bringing in seven new faces.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lyanco's arrival from Torino is the latest capture, to go alongside the likes of Adam Armstrong.<br>
</p>
<p>
But there is a strong argument that more investments are still very much needed in the senior squad if Ralph Hasenhuttl is to be given a fighting chance this season, having lost their talisman Danny Ings and defensive totem Jannik Vestergaard.<br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Left-back, centre-back, midfielder<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Ryan Christie (Celtic), Ainsley Maitland-Niles (Arsenal)<br>
</p>
<p>
Harry Kane's future was the cloud hanging over Spurs' plans - cave in to Manchester City's megabucks and a squad overhaul was coming; but now he's staying, Daniel Levy is unlikely to sanction much big spending, as always. <br>
</p>
<p>
Fiorentina target man Dusan Vlahovic was Kane's most likely replacement up front, but a winger is also highly coveted, as is a midfielder. Noni Madueke is now out of reach after he signed a new contract at PSV, but 18-year-old Pape Sarr has agreed to join for around £15m, although he will head back to Metz on loan.<br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Winger, forward, midfielder, centre-back, full-back<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Adama Traore (Wolves), Khvicha Kvaratskhelia (Rubin Kazan), Dusan Vlahovic (Fiorentina), Domingos Duarte (Granada), Takehiro Tomiyasu (Bologna)<br>
</p>
<p>
Another side returening to the top flight, Watford aren't blessed with bountiful amounts of cash but are desperate to add a bit of stardust to the squad, while continuing to resist the temptation to cash in on Ismaila Sarr. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Midfielder, winger<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Isaac Hayden (Newcastle), Glen Kamara (Rangers), Ademola Lookman (RB Leipzig)<br>
</p>
<p>
The Hammers have one eye on former Everton man Nikola Vlasic as they look to add goals this season, while there is a growing belief that a deal can now be struck with London rivals Chelsea regarding top defensive target Kurt Zouma. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Centre-back, midfielder, forward<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Kurt Zouma (Chelsea), Nikola Vlasic (CSKA Moscow), Mohamed Bayo (Clermont), Jonathan Bamba (Lille)<br>
</p>
<p>
Plenty of potential for more incomings and outgoings at Molineux, despite Wolves adding some exciting talent this summer with the likes of Barcelona's Portuguese prodigy Trincao.<br>
</p>
<p>
It comes as a little surprise that Wolves are once again sniffing around talents hailing from Portugal, as super agent Jorge Mendes continues to work his magic in the background. <br>
</p>
<p>
What they want: Centre-back, midfielder, winger, striker<br>
</p>
<p>
Who they like: Yokuslu (Celta Vigo), Ademola Lookman (RB Leipzig), Goncalo Guedes (Valencia), Kieffer Moore (Cardiff), Salomon Rondon (Dalian)<br>

'I'd had enough, I went 'f****** no!': Roy Keane recalls famous bust-up with Mick McCarthy at 2002 World Cup after the pair previously got into a row at USA 1994 after the ex-Manchester United player showed up late after drinking</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/25/14/47086683-0-image-a-6_1629899239743.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Roy Keane has recalled his tense relationship with former Republic of Ireland team-mate and manager Mick McCarthy.<br>
</p>
<p>
The ex-Manchester United midfielder was famously sent home from the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea after a bust-up with McCarthy.<br>
</p>
<p>
It came eight years after a row when McCarthy, who was still in his playing career, shouted at Keane for arriving to the team bus late after drinking with team-mates the night before during the 1994 World Cup in the United States.<br>
</p>
<p>
Keane spoke to former United team-mate Gary Neville about their relationship on the latter's Overlap Youtube channel.<br>
</p>
<p>
Regarding the incident at USA 1994 he said: 'Me and Mick, we had a falling out in America again, we said a few things to each other.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Listen, I was out of order I was out drinking but I was drinking with loads of other lads. We'd been drinking and I was late for the bus. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Jack Charlton was having a go at me, Jack's the manager but I didn't want a player having a go at me who's never spoke to me.<br>
</p>
<p>
'If Packie Bonner or David O'Leary, who probably helped me, were saying it I would sayI would take that, but not from somebody who never spoke a word to me - and he was shouting at me in front of everybody. So that would have been the start of it.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Eight years later Keane was sent home from their training base on the Pacific Island of Saipan.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Manchester United legend was unhappy with the preparations of the team ahead of their huge opportunity to shine on the global stage, and challenged his boss in front of the entire team and staff over the facilities and training gear not arriving on time.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, Keane said that this wasn't the row that led to him being sent home and they had another bust-up a week later when he claimed McCarthy accused him of missing Ireland's second leg play-off match with Iran to reach the World Cup. <br>
</p>
<p>
He said:  'And then for a manager again, team meeting, with senior players around you going "you could have played in this (match)". <br>
</p>
<p>
'We qualified for the World Cup in 2002, do you not remember the group we had? Holland, Portugal with 10 matches. Won seven, drew three we had the same points as Portugal but we had to go to the play-offs.<br>
</p>
<p>
'If I remember I played in all of the games. I played the first play-off match then missed the second one as I had an injury. So in 12 qualifying games I played 11 and missed one.<br>
</p>
<p>
'And strangely enough, these are the facts, for a manager to bring up to a senior player, yes, I was captain but still the same, that I could have played in that match it's bizarre to accuse me of missing a match.<br>
</p>
<p>
'People talk about the equipment and gear but we moved on from that, that was the week earlier.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Keane though did hit out at Ireland's preparations for the World Cup saying that was the moment he 'had enough' and it was the time Ireland needed to 'stop laughing'.<br>
</p>
<p>
He said: 'Imagine if that was England or France or Brazil, but for some reason it's Ireland it's like 'it's funny, it's Ireland' - I couldn't get my head around it but I did after a few days. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I was like "I have to move on". I was fuming and I let a few people know I wasn't happy, including the manager, but moved on because next we were flying to the official training ground, which was with FIFA, which I was thinking "FIFA's going to be fine".'<br>
</p>
<p>
He added: 'But imagine you go to a training session and I remember we didn't qualify a week before, so it was "yeah a little bit tight to get the gear over"... we qualified six months earlier.<br>
</p>
<p>
'And you laugh at it Gary, I laughed, I had been laughing for years with Ireland - "yeah this is what we do, we're Irish, we win or lose" - but I just had enough, I went "f***ing no".<br>
</p>
<p>
'We qualified out of an unbelievably tough group, Holland never qualified from our group and people were going "there's no gear at all". Well there must be footballs, "no footballs, no bibs, nothing". It was like if you're sitting in a training pitch and you go "is this for real?" <br>
</p>
<p>
'And all the others lads were laughing I was looking at all of the lads and thinking 'that's why you are winning f*** all some of you at your clubs. So there was a bit of that going on and I was like "the laughing has got to stop now". <br>
</p>
<p>
'We had Irish fans selling their television to go follow Ireland. They still want to see Ireland winning. I don't care what anyone says. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I had that when I was a player and when I was with Martin and they replaced us because we didn't win enough matches at the end, which was a disgrace when they replaced Martin with Mick McCarthy and Stephen Kenny, which is another story.'<br>

<h2>
'Instagram will get me the f***ing job?': Roy Keane jokes that 'someone should have told him years ago' that having 1.5m social media followers could help land him a management role as he eyes a return to the hot-seat</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/12/47125411-0-image-a-34_1629976758721.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Roy Keane has joked that 'someone should have told him years ago' that social media could help land him a management role. <br>
</p>
<p>
Keane - who has 1.5million followers on Instagram - has not taken charge of a club since leaving Ipswich in 2011, but did assist Martin O'Neill at Nottingham Forest in 2019. <br>
</p>
<p>
As a result, he has told Gary Neville that he is desperate to get back into coaching and joked that his decision to create a social media account during lockdown could help. <br>
</p>
<p>
Keane - who is notorious for his hatred of social media - was shocked to hear about the benefits he could receive from his mass following on Instagram.<br>
</p>
<p>
Having clocked up 1.5m followers in the first 27 weeks of having an account, Neville joked that the platform could help Keane transition back into management. <br>
</p>
<p>
The former Manchester United captain found the whole situation hilarious and responded saying: 'Instagram could get me a job. So if I get my pro license and all my experience, Instagram will get me the f***ing job. That’s great that. Should have told me that years ago. Jesus.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The discussion over Keane's use of social media use came from the pair's conversation on Gary Neville’s The Overlap YouTube channel. <br>
</p>
<p>
When Neville asked Keane where he saw himself in five years, the Irishman responded saying he was looking to make a sensational return to management as he believes he 'could be a good boss'.    <br>
</p>
<p>
'I am pretty content in what I am doing at the moment but I have my days where I get restless like everyone else', said Keane. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I ask myself do I want to get back into management but realistically where am I going to go back into? The Championship? The top of League One?'<br>
</p>
<p>
When pressed on whether he would like to return to management, Keane said: 'Yeah. It’s not easy when I went into management but there is something in there that makes me think I could be a good manager. That’s what’s pulling me to make me go back in.'  <br>
</p>
<p>
The fiery Irishman has had mixed success as a manager. He achieved promotion to the Premier League with Sunderland in 2007 and then kept them in the top flight the following season. However, a poor run of results saw him stand down from the job in 2008. <br>
</p>
<p>
Keane went on to complete a spell as Ipswich manager before taking up an assistant role with O'Neill at Aston Villa and the Republic of Ireland. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, he left the managerial side of football to become one of Sky Sports' main pundits with a reputation for being outspoken. <br>
</p>
<p>
Now, two years on, Keane is looking to make a sensational return to management and Neville believes his rise to social media stardom during lockdown could help with the transition. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, Neville did question why the Irishman decided to set up an Instagram account given the fact he has never shied away from voicing his disapproval over such apps.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Keane - who previously criticised the 2015 Arsenal squad for being more interested in taking selfies than winning trophies - said: 'It was my youngest daughter, she said "go on dad". <br>
</p>
<p>
'We were in lockdown and she goes, can you do it dad for a bit of a laugh. So I said come on then let’s do it for a bit of a laugh, bit of fun. So yeah I’m doing it for my daughter.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Keane is known for his stern views as a pundit on Sky Sports, but he shows a more relaxed and comical side to himself on social media.<br>
</p>
<p>
One of his most liked posts was a picture of himself and his grandson glaring into the camera. Keane captioned it: 'Just like his grandad, always smiling!'. <br>
</p>
<p>
The hilarious post, which was Keane's third after joining the platform, received over 6,000 likes and 6,500 comments. <br>
</p>
<p>
As a result of the popularity of his posts, Keane revealed that he had been approached about the management of his profile.   <br>
</p>
<p>
He said: 'People have said to me, who is your team? Where is your team based? And I went where is my team? As if I have a team. It’s me and my 16-year-old daughter. She is the chief executive.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Neville went on to ask whether his daughter still managed the account, to which Keane replied: 'We say manage it… f***ing hell I mean we say "can we do a picture" and we do a picture, is that managing it?'<br>
</p>
<p>
The Sky Sports pundit has already racked up 1.5million followers on his page - without following a single person.<br>
</p>
<p>
Neville, who has 1.3m followers after joining Instagram in 2016, expressed his surprise at Keane's following. <br>
</p>
<p>
He said: 'I checked this morning and you had 1.4m followers!', to which Keane replied: 'right, what does that mean? Will it get me a job?'  <br>
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Keane has expressed his desire to return to management - with Sportsmail previously revealing his appetite for the hot-seat.  <br>

Chelsea's fashion show! Champions League winners unveil new green and black third kit they say is inspired by 'London streetwear fashion' and primed for big European nights</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/12/47126053-0-image-a-30_1629977889149.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Chelsea have revealed their third kit for big European nights ahead of the new Champions League campaign.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The reigning European champions find out who they will face in the group stage of the tournament on Thursday evening as they look to defend the trophy they won in Porto back in May.<br>
</p>
<p>
They claim the kit is 'reflective' of the club's 'youthful energy' and inspired by 'London streetwear fashion'.    <br>
</p>
<p>
The green and black shirt also has crimson which is said to add 'vibrancy' and a 'pop of colour'.   <br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea's statement with the launch of the kit on the official website said: 'As Chelsea aim to add further honours to the Champions League title we won last season, the club’s 2021-22 third kit is reflective of a modern era for the club, characterised by youthful energy and everything that represents.'<br>
</p>
<p>
It adds: 'The green and black has long been associated with statement Nike outerwear pieces, the crimson adds vibrancy and that pop of colour is reflective of the club’s youthful energy.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile on social media they said the shirt was ready to take 'centre stage under the European lights'.<br>
</p>
<p>
There is a 'Pride of London' logo on the inside of the jersey which is claimed to 'serve a reminder of the club's values and status in the capital'. <br>
</p>
<p>
The kit is constructed with recycled polyester fabric from plastic bottles which is said to 'allow the kit to help deliver peak performance,' while reducing the impact on the environment.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea stars Mateo Kovacic, Hakim Ziyech and Antonio Rudiger are all seen pictured in the new jersey.<br>
</p>
<p>
Most fans on social media liked the kit, while others instead asked about when the club will confirm the signings of Jules Kounde from Sevilla and Saul Niguez from Atletico Madrid.<br>
</p>
<p>
One supporter commented: 'No way you've made a kit that I can like from first sight' while another Twitter user replied: 'We love it... But announce Saul and Kounde ASAP.'<br>
</p>
<p>
There were others who commented that the kit was 'made for' Chelsea star Hakim Ziyech, comparing to it to Ajax's green away kit from the 2019-20 season.<br>
</p>
<p>
One Twitter user posted: 'This kit was made for Hakim Ziyech' while another commented: 'Ajax Ziyech is fully back'.<br>
</p>
<p>
There were some fans though who were not so keen as one commented: 'Personally not keen. Too busy from me and we seem to be moving further away from the Chelsea we all know recognise and love when it comes to kits.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea supporters can pick up the kit at the club store online, with a 'match' shirt costing £104.95 and a 'stadium' version £69.95.   <br>
</p>
<p>
The kit has been revealed on the same day Chelsea will find out who they will face in the group stage of the Champions League.<br>
</p>
<p>
Thomas Tuchel's side won the trophy last season by beating Manchester City 1-0 thanks to a goal from Kai Havertz.<br>

<h2>
Scott McTominay is ruled out of Man United's clash with Wolves this weekend after undergoing groin surgery... and the midfielder will also miss three crucial World Cup qualifiers for Scotland</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/26/08/47119731-0-image-a-6_1629964495634.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Scotland and Manchester United have been dealt a blow ahead of their upcoming fixtures, with midfielder Scott McTominay sidelined for surgery on his groin.     <br>
</p>
<p>
The 24-year-old is set to play a key role in United's midfielder this season, and began his season with a superb performance against Leeds United in a 5-1 victory.   <br>
</p>
<p>
However, McTominay could only manage 14 minutes of the 1-1 draw against Southampton, with United revealing the 24-year-old was struggling with the groin throughout.  <br>
</p>
<p>
'Scott has undergone surgery for an ongoing groin injury that was causing significant pain when playing,' the club wrote in a statement. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Having tried all other treatment options in pre-season, surgery was deemed necessary to resolve the issue.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We hope to have him back soon.'    <br>
</p>
<p>
The midfielder will miss United's clash with Wolves on Sunday at Molineux, as well as Scotland's Word Cup qualifiers against Denmark, Moldova and Austria.        <br>
</p>
<p>
The Scotland star added a note to his fans on Instagram: 'Just to let you all know I've had minor surgery on an issue which has needed managing for the last couple of months.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I hate missing games so to be missing Wolves on the weekend & the international break is so disappointing but that's part & parcel of the game. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Wishing all the boys the best of luck & I will be back sooner than you think.'  <br>
</p>
<p>
Fred and Nemanja Matic began the St Mary's disappointment and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will likely pick the Sebian once more at Molineux. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Norwegian boss was impressed with McTominay against Leeds, singling-out the scot for praise after a disrupted pre-season. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Scott running on was a big thing. He's not played more than 20 minutes in pre-season, and he's played them at centre-back,' Solskjaer said after the Old Trafford match-up. <br>
</p>
<p>
'It was one of those where you kept him under wraps because you knew this was a game for him. Scott times his arrival great, like Scholesy did. Scott is a beast, physically, he can run all day. He was excellent, a proper man out there.'<br>
