'At what point did Bale lose so much muscle mass?': Shocked Real fan points out a stark difference in the star's physique over just six months, after he was criticised for posting about his club online</h2>

<ul><li><b>
Gareth Bale has returned to training ahead of his belated Real Madrid return</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Pictures released of the forward's physical condition have left fans shocked</b>

Bale appears to have lost some of his muscle mass compared to six months ago</b>

By Daniel Davis For Mailonline </b>
<p>
A shocked Real Madrid supporter has been left stunned by Gareth Bale's notably thinner physique, with the forward facing an uncertain future in Spain.<br>
</p>
<p>
Bale has been snapped in training today, but appears to have lost some muscle mass over a six month period before injury woes derailed his season.<br>
</p>
<p>
The transformation has caused several online users to become speechless, with one account comparing the forward's condition over the last half-year.<br>
</p>
<p>
'At what point did Bale lose so much muscle mass?' one post from a Madrid fan account read. 'Only six months' difference.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The former Tottenham man uploaded a picture of himself in a session today, the first time he has posted about his club on social media since August.<br>
</p>
<p>
He has not played for them since the 1-0 victory against Real Betis, and his campaign took another blow when he tested positive for coronavirus.<br>
</p>
<p>
Spanish publication AS took aim at the winger in the wake of his upload.<br>
</p>
<p>
They said: 'Bale has never been characterised by being excessively close with fans on his social networks, but perhaps this absence has been striking for everyone.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The Welsh footballer had been absent from his official profiles since mid-November and had not shared anything related to Real Madrid since last August. Until today.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking this month, Carlo Ancelotti said: 'Bale is not injured, but he is not well.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We have to do everything possible to make sure he feels well. If you are not feeling well, you are scared of having an issue. We have to evaluate it.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Bale played for Wales in November for their 5-1 victory over Belarus, the last time he has taken to the field competitively.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 32-year-old's contract is set to run down at the end of the season - and it is increasingly unlikely that he will be offered an extension by the club.<br>

Frank Lampard could be in pole position for the Everton job after Friday's talks with the Toffees holding FINAL discussions with ex-Chelsea boss and Vitor Pereira before making appointment... and caretaker Duncan Ferguson will also interviewed</h2>

Sportsmail report that Everton would hold further discussions with Lampard</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
If talks go well with Lampard than he could find himself in pole position</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Sources claim the Toffees want someone in place before the weekend</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Pereira had emerged as Everton's No 1 choice before supporter protests</b>
</li><br>
</ul>

By Sami Mokbel and Dominic King for the Daily Mail  </b>
<p>
Everton will hold a decisive round of talks with Vitor Pereira and Frank Lampard as they close in appointing their next boss.<br>
</p>
<p>
Caretaker head coach Duncan Ferguson will also be interviewed one last time for the vacancy as the Toffees aim to wrap up their search for Rafa Benitez's replacement within the next 48 hours.<br>
</p>
<p>
MailOnline reported on Thursday that Lampard had emerged as a lead candidate for the position and would hold further discussions with Everton about the vacancy.<br>
</p>
<p>
Those discussions are scheduled for Friday and if they go positively the Chelsea legend could find himself in pole position ahead of Pereira.<br>
</p>
<p>
Former Porto boss Pereira was owner Farhad Moshiri's No 1 choice to replace Benitez at the start of the week, the former Porto boss arriving in England to effectively seal his appointment.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, protests from supporters have put Pereira's job hopes in jeopardy. Sportsmail spoke to Pereira on Wednesday in which he said that he was saddened by the backlash against the club's plans to name him as head coach - sentiments he later confirmed in an extraordinary interview with Sky Sports News.<br>
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the resentment even pushed Pereira into considering withdrawing from the race altogether.<br>
</p>
<p>
And on Thursday night, as the 52-year-old prepared for another round of discussions for a job he looked virtually certain of being offered as late as Tuesday evening, there remained misgivings from figures close to the coach about how the process has panned out.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Pereira, who first met Moshiri on a yacht in Monaco last week, remains in the contention despite what has been a turbulent week for the Portuguese and he will be given one more opportunity to impress Everton.<br>
</p>
<p>
But the reality remains that having arrived in London on Monday expecting to be appointed, Pereira now faces the prospect of being in England for close to a week but not becoming Everton's new manager - a scenario that is likely to frustrate the ex-Olympiacos boss.<br>
</p>
<p>
And even if he is appointed Everton's new manager, he is likely to face a battle to win over supporters who have protested so vociferously against him - a reality that won't be lost on Pereira.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ferguson, who is currently in caretake charge, will also meet Everton owner Moshiri and other board members.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Scot, who is popular among the players, wants the opportunity to replace Benitez and will have an opportunity to impress the hierarchy.<br>
</p>
<p>
It is understood Everton are still to request permission from Derby to speak to Wayne Rooney.<br>

<h2>
Traore furore! Wolves star Adama is finalising a loan move to BARCELONA after snubbing a permanent Tottenham switch, leaving Antonio Conte still stuck with none of the signings he demanded from Daniel Levy</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/01/27/16/53448821-0-image-a-16_1643301310298.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
Adama Traore didn't want to play wing-back for Tottenham with Antonio Conte</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Now, Barcelona have made a move to re-sign the 26-year-old from Wolves</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Talks are based around a loan deal with a 30m option to buy in the summer</b>
</li><br>
</ul>

<p>
Adama Traoreis finalising a loan move to Barcelona after his switch to Tottenham stalled.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Spanish side are offering a loan with 30million option to buy for the 26-year old<br>
</p>
<p>
Traore was expected to join Tottenham this week but was not sold on the idea of converting to a wing back under Antonio Conte.<br>
</p>
<p>
Talks are now advancing with Barca, where he started his career. There is hope he will have a medical at Barca on Friday if talks on the structure of the deal continue in same vein.<br>
</p>
<p>
Traore left the Spanish giants in 2015 to join Aston Villa and has also played for Middlesbrough before joining Wolves in 2018.<br>
</p>
<p>
Spurs saw an initial 15m bid rejected by Wolves last week but were hoping to come back in and reach an agreement with their Premier League colleagues.<br>
</p>
<p>
Spain international Traore has played 25 times for club and country this season, scoring once.<br>
</p>
<p>
Barcelona are battling it out to finish in the top four in LaLiga and qualify for next season's Champions League.<br>
</p>
<p>
They are currently fifth in the standings, a point behind Atletico Madrid who they play in their next league match on February 6.<br>
</p>
<p>
The move will be a blow for Spurs and Conte, with the Italian coach desperately seeking reinforcements before the January transfer window ends.<br>
</p>
<p>
Like Barcelona, Champions League qualification is the primary aim for Tottenham's season and they are seventh in the Premier League at present.<br>
</p>
<p>
They trail fourth-place Manchester United by two points and have two games in hand on the Red Devils.<br>

<p>
South America's World Cup qualifiers are hotting up as the continent's stars return to action with back-to-back games across Thursday and Friday and more next week.<br>
</p>
<p>
With four games left to play, Brazil and Argentina have already booked their place in Qatar.<br>
</p>
<p>
But some teams have it all left to play for, with giants Uruguay and Chile at risk of missing out.<br>
</p>
<p>
The biggest battle is set to be for third and fourth with those teams joining Brazil and Argentina and fifth place facing an intercontinental playoff.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ecuador almost have qualification in their grasp as they sit in third, with a six-point cushion over fourth place Colombia.<br>
</p>
<p>
But the Ecuadorians have to take on table toppers Brazil on Thursday andthe stadium in Quito will be without fans due to the high national numbers of COVID-19.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, providing they do not self-destruct and every other result does not go against them, they are expected to return to the World Cup after missing out in Russia.<br>
</p>
<p>
The two teams behind them are Colombia and Peru who meet on Friday.<br>

The two are separated on goal difference, both sitting on 17 points, with Colombia squeezing into the last automatic qualifying spot and Peru currently facing the playoffs.<br>
</p>
<p>
The clash in Baranquilla could be the decider between the two sides as Peru will look to creep ahead of Colombia, who have failed to score in their last five games.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chile have hauled themselves back into contentionwith three wins in their last four games to sit one point behind Peru.<br>
</p>
<p>
They have the chance to leapfrog both Peru and Colombia if they win and and the latter's clash ends in a draw.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Martin Lasarte's side will be tested by Argentina, who have already secured passage to Qatar.<br>
</p>
<p>
Although Argentina will be without Lionel Messi, Chile will have to rely on thestrike force of Alexis Sanchezand Stoke-born Ben Brereton Diaz to bring Argentina's record of six consecutive clean sheets to an end.<br>
</p>
<p>
Uruguay also have a chance to sneak into the qualifying spots if the results go in their favour but it is looking increasingly likely that they could be the giants to miss out on this year's World Cup - something they have not done since 2006.<br>
</p>
<p>
They are outside the favourites to qualify, after failing to secure a win since September.<br>
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see how they fare under the guidance of new boss Diego Alonso in their final games - firstly againsta Paraguayan side who have a slim chance of qualifying, followed by Venezuela.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mathematically, Paraguay have a slim chance ofsneaking into the playoff place, but it would take a miracle.<br>
</p>
<p>
So far they have only beaten Venezuela and to stand a chance they need to win all four of their remaining games, including an away trip to Brazil, who have never losta World Cup qualifier at home.<br>
</p>
<p>
Bolivia are just one point behind Uruguay and need a victory to keep their hopes of making it to Qatar alive.<br>
</p>
<p>
They have won three of their last five and travel to face rock bottom Venezuela on Friday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Venezuela's campaign has been a disaster from the beginning as they have won just two of their qualifying games.<br>
</p>
<p>
They had dreamed of making their World Cup debut in Qatar but their focus will have already turn to 2026.<br>

Ex-Tottenham Hotspur record signing Chris Armstrong faces jail for punching Tesco worker and trashing store when they refused to sell him cigarettes</h2>

<p>
Tottenham Hotspur's former record signing Chris Armstrong is facing jail after trashing his local Tesco store and punching a worker to the floor after he was told he could not buy cigarettes.<br>
</p>
<p>
Former 4.5million transfer Armstrong, 50, ran amok at the supermarket in Fulham Road, Chelsea, when he was told the shop was shut at 2.15am on July 18.<br>
</p>
<p>
The former Spurs and Palace frontman caused 2,000 of damage when he kicked over security scanners and punched Alex Boatang.<br>
</p>
<p>
Dreadlocked Armstrong appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today smartly dressed in a black suit and tie.<br>
</p>
<p>
He admitted common assault and criminal damage.<br>
</p>
<p>
Prosecutor Nathan Fuller said: 'Officers were called to Tesco because of a report of an aggressive and violent man smashing up the store.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He gained access to the store by forcing his way through the door demanding cigarettes.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The store was temporarily closed because the staff were taking a break.<br>
</p>
<p>
'When he was told he couldn't buy cigarettes he became aggressive.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Armstrong kicked over security scanners, a stand of baskets and damaged other property in the store.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mr Boatang then tried to confront Armstrong, telling him to stop.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Armstrong 'turned and punched the worker in the face with a closed fist,' said Mr Fuller.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mr Boatang fell to the floor and was kicked in the shin by the former footballer.<br>
</p>
<p>
The store worker suffered injuries including a grazed leg and was taken to hospital to be checked over.<br>
</p>
<p>
Armstrong fled the scene but he was detained by officers a shortly afterwards.<br>
</p>
<p>
McKenzie Webster, defending, described the incident was an 'impulsive and short-lived assault'.<br>
</p>
<p>
She said he did not realise the shop was closed but there was a problem with the locking mechanism so the doors were partially open.<br>
</p>
<p>
Armstrong knows the shop well and has been purchasing cigarettes there for 14 years, she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chair of the bench Alan Elias ordered probation reports but warned: 'We do think the community order threshold has been passed'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Armstrong, who lives in Chelsea, was granted bail ahead of sentence at Westminster Magistrates' Court on March 1.<br>
</p>
<p>
Born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne he started his career at Wrexham in 1989 and played for Millwall before joining Crystal Palace.<br>
</p>
<p>
After netting 45 times for the Eagles he became Spurs' most expensive signing at the time when he joined for 4.5m in 1995.<br>
</p>
<p>
He earned an England call-up under Kevin Keegan but only played one 'B' international and ended his career back at Wrexham in 2005.<br>
</p>
<p>
Armstrong became the first-ever Premier League player to fail a drug test after testing positive for cannabis in March 1995.<br>
</p>
<p>
He was convicted of possessing cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court and fined 375 in September 2016.<br>

<h2>
Newcastle SHOULD meet Manchester United's demands for Jesse Lingard as it will be WORTH IT if he keeps them in the Premier League, says ex-Toon striker Les Ferdinand... with the club's Saudi owners reluctant to accept a hefty loan package worth 16.5m</h2>

<li><b>
United want the Magpies to pay Lingard's 100,000-a-week wages in full</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
They are also demanding a 12m bonus if he keeps them in the Premier League</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Les Ferdinand believes his ex-club should accept to boost their survival hopes</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<b>
By Oliver Salt For Mailonline </b>
<p>
Ex-Newcastle striker Les Ferdinand has told his former club that paying over the odds to sign Jesse Lingard will be worth it if he keeps them in the Premier League.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lingard, 29, is expected to leave Manchester United on loan this month after playing just 12 minutes of Premier League football under interim boss Ralf Rangnick.<br>
</p>
<p>
Newcastle emerged as the frontrunners to prise him away from Old Trafford before the January transfer window closes on Monday, but talks between St James' Park chiefs and United have since hit a stumbling block.<br>
</p>
<p>
It is believed the Magpies are not prepared to pay a loan fee and 12million survival battle if they avoid relegation to the Championship this season. United also want them to cover his 100,000-a-week wages in full.<br>
</p>
<p>
The entire could end up costing around 16.5million, which Newcastle's Saudi owners are reluctant to fork out.<br>
</p>
<p>
Yet Ferdinand, who scored 50 goals in 84 appearances for the club, has urged them to meet United's demands if it helps them stay in the Premier League.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 55-year-old said on talkSPORT: 'It's the just the way the Premier League is and the way it works.<br>
</p>
<p>
'If Jesse Lingard goes there and keeps Newcastle in the division, what is it worth to Newcastle and what they're trying to do?<br>
</p>
<p>
'I understand it's business and sometimes people have a commodity they're trying to get, but if you want that commodity you have to pay for it.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Unfortunately, sometimes the prices have been inflated but that's the way the Premier League is at the moment.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Lingard rejected a move back to West Ham last summer after scoring nine goals in 16 games on loan with David Moyes' side in the second half of last season, instead deciding to stay and fight for his place at United.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer only afforded him six appearances in their first 12 league matches - none of which were starts - before he was sacked in November.<br>
</p>
<p>
And since Rangnick replaced the Norwegian until the end of the season, Lingard has only made two brief outings in nine games.<br>
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, Rangnick bizarrely confirmed to a fan on TikTok that the England international will be leaving United this summer.<br>

Emma Hayes SLAMS disparity in prize money between FA Cup competitions, with women's winners earning 25,000 - less than TWO per cent of men's winnings of 1.8MILLION</h2>

<ul><li><b>
A weekend fan-led protest calling for an 'Equal FA Cup' will take place at games</b>

The fourth round in the women's game sees winners taking home just 2,000</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Meanwhile in the men's competition, fourth-round winners receive 90,000</b>

Chelsea Women's manager Emma Hayes called the difference 'unacceptable'</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<b>
By Kathryn Batte For Mailonline </b>
<p>
Emma Hayes has slammed the disparity in prize money for the men and women's FA Cup competitions as 'completely unacceptable'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The fourth round in the women's game takes place this weekend with winners set to receive 2,000, while losers will pick up just 500. Victorious teams in the fourth round of the men's competition will receive 90,000.<br>
</p>
<p>
A fan-led protest calling for an 'Equal FA Cup' will take place at games this weekend.<br>
</p>
<p>
Hayes' Chelsea beat Arsenal to win last season's competition in December but picked up less than two per cent of what Leicester received for their triumph in the men's final.<br>
</p>
<p>
Winners of this year's women's FA Cup will earn 25,000 but there is 1.8million on offer to the team that lifts the men's competition and 900,000 for the runners-up.<br>
</p>
<p>
'That's unbelievable,' Hayes said of the difference.<br>
</p>
<p>
'This has to shift, it really does, [less than] five per cent of the total amount, because when we talk about the likes of Coventry going through a liquidation process or seeking a buyer, think about the impact an appearance in the FA Cup could make for them, if they were to receive prize money.<br>
</p>
<p>
'What people don't realise about the prize money, and I'm not talking about Chelsea, I'm not talking about the top clubs, I'm talking about the trickle-down effect.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's the same for the broadcasting, we have to keep pushing, because the fact that we get [less than] five per cent of that total fund is completely unacceptable.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The issue of prize money was raised by Labour MP Alison McGovern during a debate on women's football in Westminster on Wednesday, which was brought about following the near collapse of Championship side Coventry United.<br>
</p>
<p>
The club was placed into voluntary liquidation two days before Christmas before a buyer was found at the eleventh hour. Despite the players being fully professional, most were not protected by the PFA due to never having played in the Women's Super League.<br>
</p>
<p>
There are five full-time teams in the Championship but the league is still classed as semi-professional.<br>
</p>
<p>
'There was a brilliant letter [to] Nadine Dorries [from Zarah Sultana], the MP for Coventry South. She wrote a wonderful letter to the Commons.' Hayes continued.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I'm really pleased she highlighted that. I actually have the letter in my pocket. This, for me, is a significant news story that we have to keep highlighting, because we must protect our smaller clubs.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We've got to grow the women's game. We can only do that with prize money and broadcasting, so for the likes of Coventry, and all those smaller clubs further down the ladder, it's absolutely critical that this is debated in Parliament.'<br>

If the missing players come back, if Diego Carlos stays, and if Madrid have problems of their own in the run-in, then Sevilla have a chance of winning what would be only the second league in their 132-year history.<br>
</p>
<p>
Signing Anthony Martial is a statement of intent  the clearest indication that Sporting Director Monchi believes the title is possible this year too.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 26-year-old was unveiled on Wednesday and will make his debut a week Saturday away at Osasuna.<br>
</p>
<p>
He has joined the club because he wants to put himself in the shop window for a permanent move next summer, and to get himself back in the France squad ahead of the next World Cup.<br>
</p>
<p>
But he's also going because Sevilla have sold the club to him  even if it's only for five months, they have convinced him that he will start enjoying being a footballer again.<br>
</p>
<p>
Real Madrid remain favourites to win the title but if they get side-tracked by the Champions League double header with Paris Saint Germain and a domestic cup run.<br>
</p>
<p>
And if Carlo Ancelotti's preference for not rotating in the first half of the season comes back to bite him at the business end of the campaign then no team will be better placed to overtake them.<br>
</p>
<p>
No one wants it more than Julen Lopetegui who knows winning the league in Spain with a club who have not managed it since 1946 would leave him with the pick of Europe's top jobs.<br>
</p>
<p>
Even running Ancelotti close and reaching the Europa League final  this year set to be played in Sevilla's Sanchez Pizjuan stadium  would edge him closer to a chance with an elite club.<br>
</p>
<p>
Manchester United are still scouring the market for options post Ralf Rangnick. If Lopetegui gets Martial playing again  something beyond Rangnick in the short time he had to work with him; and also for the most part beyond Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Jose Mourinho  then it would put him in the frame for that job too.<br>
</p>
<p>
At first Martial is likely to be back in the central striking berth he favours. He won't wear nine because that's already been taken by another recent recruit, the Mexican Tecatito Corona, but he will be the team's nominal nine while the Moroccan forward Youssef En-Nesyri plays the African Nations Cup.<br>
</p>
<p>
When En-Nesyri returns there might be the need for more flexibility. Lopetegui favours a 4-3-3 and both Martial and En-Nesyri could play in any of the front three positions along with live wire Argentinian Lucas Ocampos.<br>
</p>
<p>
However the chips fall Sevilla have boosted their attack in a way few of their supporters believed possible when whispers of the club going for Martial first emerged.<br>
</p>
<p>
They have not been deterred by Manchester United supporters admitting they are glad to see the back of Martial. Sevilla have rehabilitated down-in-the-mouth strikers before.<br>
</p>
<p>
When Frederic Kanoute left Tottenham for Sevilla in 2005 it didn't seem like Spurs might regret allowing him to leave but the Mali striker went on to win six trophies and finished up as the fourth highest scorer in the club's history.<br>
</p>
<p>
Martial was asked about Sevilla's French connection in his presentation press conference yesterday. He will have Jules Kounde to help him acclimatize with the central defender, wanted for two seasons running by Chelsea, almost certain to stay at the club until June.<br>
</p>
<p>
Slightly less certain is the future of Diego Carlos. Sevilla have no intention of accepting a bid of just 35m euros for their defensive leader. The same bid made in the summer might have more success with time to spend the money and rebuild.<br>
</p>
<p>
But with the clock ticking on the transfer window Sevilla, even with one of the game's best Sporting Directors, would be hard pushed to adequately cover his departure.<br>
</p>
<p>
A silly bid  closer to 60m euros would make for a change of heart but as they days go by it becomes harder to envisage them having their arm twisted, there is so much at stake.<br>
</p>
<p>
To use the famous Spanish football idiom signing Martial and losing Diego Carlos would be like pulling the blanket up around the ears only to expose the feet  one step forward and another back, in other words.<br>
</p>
<p>
If they can keep their centre-back and if Sevilla can put a smile back on Martial's face (he was laughing on Wednesday during the usual misunderstandings of a translator-assisted press conference) then all bodes well for the end of Sevilla's season.<br>
</p>
<p>
'In football who knows,' he said when asked if he might stay beyond the original five months. 'For now it's just for five months'.<br>
</p>
<p>
If in those five months he helps Sevilla win a trophy  either the Europa League in their own stadium, or La Liga, would be historic achievements  then everyone will be happy.<br>

Isak is the perfect replacement for Aubameyang, Calvert-Lewin could fix their aerial woes... but is Real Madrid outcast Jovic worth the trouble? Who Arsenal should turn to after losing out on Dusan Vlahovic to Juventus</h2>

</li><br>
<li><b>
Arsenal have also lost out on No 1 striker target Dusan Vlahovic, say reports</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Sportsmail looks at other striker options for Arsenal with the window closing</b>
</li><br>
</ul>

By Sam Blitz For Mailonline </b>
<p>
Arsenal are gunning for the top four this season but are lacking a major marksman up front.<br>
</p>
<p>
This a crucial time for the Gunners and manager Mikel Arteta, who are reaching yet another crossroads in their time together at the Emirates Stadium. Fourth-place is well within their reach this season, but there are clear areas of concern for Arsenal.<br>
</p>
<p>
A dismal January which saw them dumped out of both cup competitions, drop points at home to bottom club Burnleyin a frustrating goalless draw and - most worryingly - score just one goal in the entire month threatens to derail their season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the striker problems are worsening in north London. Former club captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang looks no closer to getting a recall into Arteta's plans, while the contracts of their other two senior forwards in Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah run out in the summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
And to make a dismal month even worse, Arsenal look set to miss out on their top striker target this month in Fiorentina's Dusan Vlahovic, who is reportedly on the way to Juventus in a 63million fee.<br>
</p>
<p>
The clock is ticking for Arsenal to get a new striker, with the winter transfer window ending on January 31. The Gunners need to find another striker solution in the market, but they won't come cheap.<br>
</p>
<p>
ALEXANDER ISAK<br>
</p>
<p>
Age: 22<br>
</p>
<p>
Club: Real Sociedad<br>
</p>
<p>
Goals since start of 2020-21 season: 25 (69 matches)<br>
</p>
<p>
Expected price tag: 75million (release clause)<br>
</p>
<p>
If Arsenal are steadfast in finding a direct replacement for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, then Real Sociedad forward Alexander Isak is their man.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Swedish striker, who impressed during Euro 2020 last summer, has excelled through the middle but can also play out wide, in a similar role which Aubameyang has adopted throughout his Gunners career.<br>
</p>
<p>
Isak knows where the goal is as well, having scored 17 times in LaLiga last season, but his time at Sociedad is slowing down slightly having netted just four times in Spain's top-flight so far this term.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal do, however, have the necessary spark to get Isak in and around the goals again.<br>
</p>
<p>
One of those means is through Martin Odegaard, who excelled alongside Isak during the 2019-20 season at Sociedad. The Norwegian midfielder assisted the Swedish striker on four separate occasions in his only campaign in San Sebastian, with Isak ending the season as the club's top scorer in all competitions.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 22-year-old forward is not just about goals, however, as he is also known for his link-up play.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arteta's Arsenal enjoy using Lacazette, who could leave this year, as a focal point to work off, rather than be a regular supplier of goals.<br>
</p>
<p>
The French forward has just two Premier League goals this season but the likes of Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka have spoken about how useful Lacazette is in terms of link-up play.<br>
</p>
<p>
Isak has already revealed he can play that role as well, while also adding a better goal threat than Lacazette.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Swedish striker told Sportsmail last year: 'It is a mix of being in a country where football fits my qualities and being at a club that really believes in me and bought me with the intention of making me a top player.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Spanish football benefits me more because I am a player who likes to touch the ball and combine with my team-mates. In Spain there is more playing, I wouldn't say tiki-taka, but more playing with the ball and it is more technical.'<br>
</p>
<p>
DOMINIC CALVERT-LEWIN<br>
</p>
<p>
Age: 24<br>
</p>
<p>
Club: Everton<br>
</p>
<p>
Goals since start of 2020-21 season: 24 (45 matches)<br>
</p>
<p>
Expected price tag: 60million<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal needs goals quickly, so Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin would provide the Gunners with a quickfire solution - to the tune of 60m - as he is already used to the demands of the Premier League.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 24-year-old forward has a brilliant all-round game with pace, precise finishing and excellent movement - but also possesses the aerial presence the Gunners have lacked up front since the Olivier Giroud days.<br>
</p>
<p>
Calvert-Lewin has scored more headed goals (eight) than any other player in the Premier League since August 2020 - and Arsenal definitely need a striker who can be a threat in the air<br>
</p>
<p>
Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale confirmed that exact point after their goalless draw with bottom club Burnley last Sunday, claiming the Gunners struggle to compete with aerial sides like the Clarets.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We didn't really take the game to them, I'll give credit to Burnley, they defended well,' Ramsdale told Arsenal.com.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We put balls in the box and that's meat and drink to Burnley, so it's a difficult one. It's definitely a missed opportunity for three points and to gain places back in the league.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Calvert-Lewin also fits into the category of young players that Arteta likes to target as new signings and develop - and the Arsenal manager will look at how the Gunners have improved Ben White and Aaron Ramsdale since they moved to north London.<br>
</p>
<p>
Like White and Ramsdale, the Everton striker was a back-up player for England at Euro 2020 and needs that spark if he is to stake a claim for Harry Kane's No 9 spot in Gareth Southgate's line-up.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Toffees striker has fallen behind Tammy Abraham in the England striker pecking order, with the Roma forward scoring 17 goals already this season and looking in red-hot form.<br>
</p>
<p>
Calvert-Lewin may feel that a change from a dwindling Everton side who are failing to match his ambitions may be the right call during 2022.<br>
</p>
<p>
LUKA JOVIC<br>
</p>
<p>
Age: 24<br>
</p>
<p>
Club: Real Madrid<br>
</p>
<p>
Goals since start of 2020-21 season: 5 (38 matches)<br>
</p>
<p>
Expected price tag: Loan with option to buy<br>
</p>
<p>
Both Calvert-Lewin and Isak would be hefty signings and could come across as January panic buys.<br>
</p>
<p>
To give Arsenal more time to make a more long-term decision, they could go for a temporary option in Real Madrid's much-maligned striker Luka Jovic, who has reportedly been offered to Arsenal on a loan until the end of the season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jovic has failed to hit the heights at the Santiago Bernabeu since his high-profile move from Eintracht Frankfurt in 2019, having scored 17 Bundesliga goals and 10 times in the Europa League before sealing the move to Spain.<br>
</p>
<p>
On his day, the Serbian striker can be the signing Arsenal need and Jovic himself will be hoping that Arsenal and the Premier League can provide him with the change of course his career definitely needs.<br>
</p>
<p>
But, as Sportsmail revealed this week, Jovic does not quite fit the character Arteta and Arsenal are looking for in their players.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 24-year-old was one of the first players to be found breaking coronavirus quarantine rules in March 2020, when he left Madrid for Serbia at the start of lockdown.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jovic had received permission from Real to head back to his country as the Covid-19 pandemic began to rage around Europe, but the forward was seen out and about in Serbia straight away, breaking their quarantine rules.<br>
</p>
<p>
The striker also has a strained relationship with the Serbian national team, having refused to play for his country after being dropped for one match at the start ofLjubisa Tumbakovic's reign.<br>
</p>
<p>
With Arteta still reeling from the saga involving former captain Aubameyang's disciplinary issues, the Arsenal boss does not want another problem player, which Jovic could well be.<br>
</p>
<p>
Loan players have not always worked out for Arsenal in the past. The likes of Denis Suarez, Julio Baptista, Dani Ceballos and Mat Ryan have endured dismal temporary spells at the Emirates Stadium, with only Odegaard a rare exception.<br>
</p>
<p>
If strikers such as Calvert-Lewin and Isak are available to sign this month, they could well be better options than the easy route of getting a temporary solution.<br>
</p>
<p>
VICTOR OSIMHEN<br>
</p>
<p>
Age: 23<br>
</p>
<p>
Club: Napoli<br>
</p>
<p>
Goals since start of 2020-21 season: 19 (46 matches)<br>
</p>
<p>
Expected price tag: 58m<br>
</p>
<p>
Like Alexander Isak, Napoli striker Victor Osimhen is another young striker who has come a long way in the last couple of years.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 23-year-old was playing at a football academy in Lagos, Nigeria five years ago and now he is one of the best young strikers in Europe.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Nigerian striker became the most expensive African player in history as Napoli forked out 58million to sign him from Lille in 2020 - and his goal return has been paying back that fee.<br>
</p>
<p>
Osimhen has frightening pace to scare any defence but is also a major threat in the air. The Napoli striker nearly broke Cristiano Ronaldo's Serie A jump record - that historic leap against Sampdoria for Juventus - when he reached 2.52 metres in the air to score a winner against Torino earlier this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
And the 23-year-old, who Arsene Wenger tried to sign as a youngster, certainly showed he is ready for the Premier League by netting twice against Leicester in the Europa League back in September.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Nigerian has certainly earned plaudits as his stock continues. Napoli boss Luciano Spalletti has described Osimhen as a 'monster' in the penalty area - which is exactly what Arsenal need - while his striker rival Dries Mertens has also lavished praise on him.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I know what he's worth and what it can become,' Mertens said this month. 'It will depend a lot on him, on his ability to manage himself.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He has scary potential, even now he affects like few others, and he is still very young. In two years, he has had to go through a lot. But now it will be his turn.'<br>
</p>
<p>
One area that may concern Arsenal is how easily Osimhen gets injured. The Nigerian has struggled with shoulder and facial injuries in the past two seasons that have kept him out for months on end.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mikel Arteta's Gunners are looking for a reliable player up front, not another star to sit on the sidelines.<br>

<p>
Neymar has stepped up his recovery from an ankle injury after taking part in an indoor session on Thursday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Paris Saint-Germain confirmed on Wednesday the 29-year-old Brazilian has started running again in training, two months after injuring his left ankle.<br>
</p>
<p>
And the club then posted images on Twitter of him working with a football and other gym equipment as he continues his reconditioning phase of his recovery.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Brazil forward suffered the ligament injury during PSG's victory at Saint-Etienne in November, with club doctors ruling him out for six to eight weeks.<br>
</p>
<p>
But a PSG medical report on Wednesday read: 'Neymar has today started running again and is now beginning the reconditioning phase on the pitch.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The former Barcelona star's return to the training pitch comes just a few days after Lionel Messi made his comeback from Covid.<br>
</p>
<p>
Messi missed his side's Ligue 1 clashes with Lyon and Brest due to the virus, but came off the bench on Sunday to play the final 27 minutes of their 4-0 win against Reims.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Argentina international will now be pushing for a start when the Ligue 1 giants face Nice in the round of 16 in the French Cup on Monday, before facing current league champions Lille on Sunday.<br>
</p>
<p>
PSG also have a mouthwatering and crucial last-16 tie against Real Madrid in the Champions League next month.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, Argentina boss Lionel Scaloni has revealed that Lionel Messiis still suffering from the effects of having Covid, after he contracted the 'roughest variant' during the winter break.<br>
</p>
<p>
Messi was not called up for Argentina's upcoming World Cup qualifiers with Chile and Colombia due to the fact that he has still not 100 per cent fully recovered from the virus, according to Scaloni.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I talked to (Messi) after he tested positive for COVID,' Scaloni told a press conference on Wednesday. 'It affected him a lot, he had the roughest variant.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It is important that he recovers, feels fit because there will be important moments ahead. I felt that it was not ideal for him to joins us [on international duty this weekend] not being at 100 per cent. He was affected for a some time.'<br>

<p>
Former Liverpool winger John Barnes has urged Arsenal outcast Pierre-Emerick Abameyang to change his attitude to salvage his career at the Emirates.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Gabon international has been exiled at Arsenal after Gunners boss Mikel Arteta stripped him of the captaincy following a third 'disciplinary breach' in December.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 32-year-old has not featured in Arteta's side since a five-minute cameo against Everton on December 6 and has been linked with a move away from Arsenal in the transfer window.<br>
</p>
<p>
Former England international Barnes has said that Aubameyang's future in the Gunner's side depends on his attitude.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Aubameyang coming back into the team depends on whether he wants to do well and has the right attitude,' Barnes said, speaking tospeaking to BonusCodeBets.<br>
</p>
<p>
'If he doesn't, there is no point bringing him back into the fold. Even if Arsenal aren't doing too well, it could make the whole situation worse.<br>
</p>
<p>
'When Arteta left out Aubameyang earlier on this season, Arsenal improved without him [Aubameyang], you can't just bring him back into the team because suddenly results have gone against you.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The manager has decided, unless Aubameyang is willing to change which looks like a relationship and attitude problem, there is only going to be one winner, which is Arteta.<br>
</p>
<p>
'For Aubameyang to get back involved we're going to have to see a marked improvement.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal managed to claw their way up to fourth before Christmas but have struggled for form in the New Year.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Gunners have had more red cards (three) than goals (one) since the turn of the year, faith in Arteta's regime is starting to dwindle again.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Barnes believes that Arteta is the right man to guide Arsenal to a brighter future.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Mikel Arteta came to Arsenal and changed the culture of the club with non-negotiables and standards to be set,' he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Since he's done this, Arsenal have reaped the benefits and the future looks bright for them.<br>

<p>
Iran got the better of bitter rivals Iraq in Tehran to become the first Asian confederation side to book their place at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this year.<br>
</p>
<p>
There were10,000 fans packed in Tehran's Azadi Stadium, with Iranian women allowed to attend for the first time in almost three years, as the Group A leaders secured victory through Mehdi Taremi's strike.<br>
</p>
<p>
Victory ensures that Dragan Skocic's Iran side are now 10 points clear of third place in their Asian qualifying group, with just nine points remaining to compete for.<br>
</p>
<p>
Later this year in Qatar it will be the sixth time Iran has qualified for the biggest tournament on the international football calendar.<br>
</p>
<p>
They first qualified in 1978 before reaching World Cups in 1998, 2006, 2014 and 2018.<br>
</p>
<p>
So far 14 teams have sealed qualification to the finals in Qatar with Germany, Denmark, Brazil, Belgium, France, England, Croatia, Spain, Serbia, Switzerland, Holland and Argentina joining Iran and hosts Qatar.<br>
</p>
<p>
A total of 32 nations will compete later this year for the World Cup with European play-offs still to be held and both Asian and South American qualifying reaching the penultimate rounds.<br>
</p>
<p>
As well as the wild celebrations at the end in Tehran, which saw fireworks let off above the stadium, it was also a landmark day for female supporters of the Iranian national team.<br>
</p>
<p>
World football's governing body FIFA ordered Iran back in September 2019 to allow women access to stadiums without restriction.<br>
</p>
<p>
Female fans, under the rules of the Islamic republic, have largely been kept away from stadiums and sporting events for more than 30 years.<br>
</p>
<p>
Iranian women were allowed entry to a2022 World Cup qualifying match between Iran and Cambodia at the Azadi Stadium back in 2019 but this represented the first match since.<br>
</p>
<p>
TheISNA news agency reported that of the 10,000 tickets sold, 2,000 were exclusively sold to women.<br>
</p>
<p>
As for Iraq, they remain sitting in fifth place in the qualifying table with just four points, as Iran stay top Group A with 19 points.<br>
</p>
<p>
The only bright moment for Iraq came with less than 10 minutes to go when 18-year-old Manchester United midfielder Zidane Iqbal came off the bench to make his international debut.<br>

REVEALED: Cristiano Ronaldo sent private messages moaning about his 75m valuation before BLOCKING football website Transfermarkt on Instagram after they compiled a team of his agent's most valuable players</h2>

<p>
Cristiano Ronaldo blocked the Instagram account of transfer website Transfermarkt in March last year after taking offence at the valuation they had given him.<br>
</p>
<p>
Transfermarkt published a 'Jorges Mendes XI' on Instagram made out of players represented by the Portuguese agent in March 2020, with Ronaldo spearheading the attack and given a valuation of75million.<br>
</p>
<p>
Shortly after publishing the graphic, Transfermarkt commented on their own post saying 'We can't tag Ronaldo because he blocked us after he saw his market value' and now they have lifted the lid on exactly what happened.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He sent a message first to our social media guys,' Christian Swartz, Tranfermarkt's coordinator, told The Athletic.<br>
</p>
<p>
'They answered him, explained why, and told him "The people in your own age group, you are by far the number one".<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think it was 30-50 million difference (between Ronaldo and the next player on the list), and then he sent some smilies, and then he blocked us.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo, then at Juventus, was actually the second-most expensive player in the XI, behind 100m-rated Bernardo Silva of Manchester City.<br>
</p>
<p>
A little over a year later, Ronaldo left Turin to return to Manchester United in a deal worth 19.8m - although the fee was influenced by Juventus looking to get his wages off their books as they counted the financial impact of the pandemic.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo turns 37 next week and thanks to his forensically precise diet and rigorous exercise plan away from the pitch, he's doing a good job of keeping father time at arm's length.<br>
</p>
<p>
He has scored 19 goals in 28 games for club and country this season and remains one of the fiercest strikers in the game - yet won't be commanding a fee above what United signed him for at his age.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo signed a two-year deal at Old Trafford but there are murmurs of uncertainty around his future at the club amid another turbulent campaign. United are fourth in the Premier League standings but just two points ahead of Tottenham, who have two games in hand.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo and his team-mates return to league action on February 8 away to Burnley.<br>

<p>
Manchester United winger Amad Diallohas signed for Scottish Premier League championsRangers on a six-month loan deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 19-year old joined United from Atalanta in a deal worth up to 37million and was due to join Feyenoord on a season-long loan back in September but an injury picked up in training put paid to that and the club have been looking for another temporary move away.<br>
</p>
<p>
But now Rangers, who are top of the Scottish Premiership and face Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League, have now completed the temporary signing of Diallo as he looks to boost his development.<br>
</p>
<p>
Diallo told the Rangers official website: 'It is fantastic for me at this stage of my career to have the opportunity to come to such a big club that is challenging on a number of fronts and will give me some excellent opportunities to test myself in many environments.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I look forward to training with my teammates for the first-time tomorrow and to meeting the fans for the first time at Ross County on Saturday.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Wayne Rooney's Derby County had made a request to take Diallo but their plight made any deal difficult.<br>
</p>
<p>
United had been keen for him to stay in the UK rather than go abroad and hope a move to Rangers can give him the right environment to kick on.<br>
</p>
<p>
Giovanni van Bronckhorst is pushing for silverware in his first season in charge and Diallo is seen as a coup for the Ibrox club and they hope the skilful forward can have an immediate impact.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Dutch manager said on Diallo's arrival: 'He is a player who I have been aware of for some time, and when the opportunity to sign him came up, we very keen to make it happen.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He will add a lot to our squad and provide even more competition for the players in the forward areas.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The 19-year-old has featured just nine times in all competitions for United's senior squad scoring one goal.<br>
</p>
<p>
This season, Diallo played 68 minutes in the 1-1 draw against Young Boys in the Champions League and was an unused sub in the 3-2 win over Arsenal in the Premier League.<br>
</p>
<p>
Diallo's contract at Old Trafford runs until 2025 and United hope a spell out on loan will help develop him into a regular member of the first-team squad.<br>

<p>
Cristiano Ronaldo was pictured doing some individual winter break work with Manchester United and Portugal team-mate Diogo Dalot in Dubai.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Portuguese duo are taking some much-needed time off following a hectic Premier League schedule over the winter, but are still taking the time to keep their fitness levels up as they prepare for the top-flight run-in.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo and Dalot were seen at the popular Nad Al Sheba (NAS) Sports Complex in Dubai, which is being used by several Premier League stars during this mini off-season, with the former claiming that he 'never misses' a day's work in the comments section.<br>
</p>
<p>
Dalot, meanwhile, is enjoying an excellent run in the side under Ralf Rangnick, having started seven out of United's last nine league games under the interim German boss.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo, meanwhile, has 14 goals in 24 matches for the Red Devils this season but only eight of them have come in the Premier League.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Portuguese duo are not the only United players currently relaxing or training out in Dubai as Paul Pogba was also spotted at the NAS centre this week.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Frenchman has not featured for the club since he was sent off in the shock 5-0 home loss to Liverpool under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer last November after he picked up an injury on international duty with France later that month.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pogba, whose contract at Old Trafford expires at the end of the season, was seen out running on the pitch in Dubai as he hopes to return to Rangnick's plans by the end of the season.<br>
</p>
<p>
United's German interim boss claimed that Pogba will give his all for the club, even if it is only the earn a contract at another big club.<br>
</p>
<p>
'By the way, my contract as a manager is also expiring in the summer,' said United's interim boss ahead of Wednesday's trip to Brentford.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We have the same goal. We have the same ambition to be as successful as we can possibly be in the next three or four months.<br>
</p>
<p>
'For me, it's not a question if a player has an expiring contract. The question is how much does he still want to be a part of this group? How much does he still feel emotionally and physically on board?<br>
</p>
<p>
'As long as this is the case, why shouldn't Paul Pogba - now after two-and-half months of injury and fully fit again - also want to show up?<br>
</p>
<p>
'He wants to show the fans of Manchester United, the board, the whole world what kind of player he can be. Even if it's only to show enough for a new contract elsewhere, he will be highly motivated to do that.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Why should I then not play him? There is a difference of how players deal with their current situation. If they handle that in a professional way, of course I will play players although they have a contact expiring in the summer.'<br>
</p>
<p>
United captain Harry Maguire is also in Dubai,taking part in a golfing Pro-Am with England team-mate Jordan Pickford as they enjoy some time away from the pitch.<br>
</p>
<p>
The England defender issued a rallying cry to his United team-mates this week, suggesting his team can improve from the 'up and down' performances they have been showing since the start of the campaign.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think a lot of people this year haven't had the most consistent of seasons, we've been up and down a lot, as outfielders and as a team performance.<br>
</p>
<p>
 'It's really important that we stay in the competitions for as long as we can and find ourselves challenging for trophies at the end of the season. In two months' time we want to be challenging in the league, for the top four positions, and then in both competitions in the cups.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We are in a position where we are not happy with the league position, but for sure we have lots of things to play for, and lots of momentum to gain, and lots of things to improve on.<br>
</p>
<p>
'From now until the end of the season we have got to work together as a group, work together as a club and make sure we reach our aims.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, United midfielder Bruno Fernandes has also been showing his winter break work on social media, by posting a video of him training back in his native Portugal.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Red Devils' next match after the winter break is a FA Cup fourth round tie with Middlesbrough on February 4, before they restart their top-four bid with a trip to Burnley four days later.<br>

By Jack Bezants for MailOnline  </b>
<p>
FIFA president Gianni Infantino has attempted to clarify remarks made in a speech about a biennial World Cup by drawing parallels to African migrants dying at sea.<br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking atto the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) on Wednesday, Infantino said: 'We need to find ways to include the entire world, to give hope to Africans so that they don't need to cross the Mediterranean in order to find, maybe, a better life, but more probably death in the sea.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We need to give opportunities and we need to give dignity, not by giving charity, but by allowing the rest of the world as well to participate.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Now, Infantino has claimed his comments were misrepresented.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Given that certain remarks made by me before the Council of Europe appear to have been misinterpreted and taken out of context, I wish to clarify that, in my speech, my more general message was that everyone in a decision-making position has a responsibility to help improve the situation of people around the world,' he said in a statement.<br>
</p>
<p>
'If there are more opportunities available, including in Africa, but certainly not limited to that continent, this should allow people to take these opportunities in their own countries.<br>
</p>
<p>
'This was a general comment, which was not directly related to the possibility of playing a FIFA World Cup every two years.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Infantino's plans for a World Cup every two years have been fiercely opposed in Europe and South America.<br>
</p>
<p>
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp slated the plans, saying: 'There's no other sport in the world with such a relentless calendar. We all know why it's happening. Whatever people say that it's about giving different countries opportunities, in the end it's all about money.<br>
</p>
<p>
'That's fine. But in the end, at one point somebody has to start understanding that without the players - the most important ingredients of this wonderful game - we cannot play it.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The Confederation of African Football (CAF) - football's governing body in Africa - supports the plans.<br>

<p>
Barcelona are planning to tie Gavi down to a new contract in February, according to reports in Spain.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 17-year-old's contract at the Nou Camp is set to expire in 2023 and clubs are said to already be circling in case he does not agree a new deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Until now, Barcelona's focus has been elsewhere, as Ansu Fati and Pedri have agreed new deals, while the club's troubles with Ousmane Dembele are on going.<br>
</p>
<p>
Gavi's agentIvan de la Pena and Barca's director of football Mateu Alemany agreed in December to hold off renewal talks until January.<br>
</p>
<p>
But with the club prioritising other deals before the transfer window closes, the two parties are yet to discuss a contract extension.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, it appears the Catalans are finally ready to begin talks with Gavi in February to discuss the expected renewal, according to Spanish outlet Sport.<br>
</p>
<p>
After being snapped up by Barcelona's academy in 2015 when he was just 11, he went on to sign his first professional contract with the club in September 2020 before being promoted to the first team the following year.<br>
</p>
<p>
He is said to be highly-regarded by Xavi, who has handed him plenty of minutes since taking the job in November.<br>
</p>
<p>
A trio of Premier League sides have been linked to the young midfielder with Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City all reportedly interested.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea have been linked to Frenkie De Jong and Sergino Dest but owner Roman Abramovich is keen on a third star from Barcelona in the form of the Spain international.<br>
</p>
<p>
Liverpool are prepared to pay Gavi '50 times more' per week than what he currently earns at Barcelona to try andtempt the youngster to Merseyside, while Manchester City are also said to be keeping tabs on Gavi.<br>

REVEALED: Jose Mourinho's decision to invent his own gong at Man United's awards bash in 2018 saw Scott McTominay given a CANDLESTICK HOLDER - because there was no trophy available</h2>

<p>
Jose Mourinho's last-minute decision to invent his own award at Manchester United's glitzy end of season ceremony in 2018 saw Scott McTominay handed a candlestick holder to take home, it has bizarrely been revealed.<br>
</p>
<p>
The evening saw goalkeeper David de Gea named as the recipient of the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year gong but, as the event drew to a close, United's then-manager stepped up to dish out another accolade.<br>
</p>
<p>
His decision took some at the club by surprise, it has since surfaced, to the extent that the desperate rush to find a piece of silverware for McTominay resulted in him being handed a particular trinket instead.<br>
</p>
<p>
TalkSPORT presenter Andy Goldstein, who worked with MUTV at the time, admitted it wasn't until halfway through the night that Mourinho's intentions became clear.<br>
</p>
<p>
He said: 'When I was doing the Man United Player of the Year awards for MUTV, and he was manager, we were doing the live show in a studio next to the awards.<br>
</p>
<p>
'You've got the bog-standard awards like the Matt Busby Award, Player of the Year, but we got wind of the fact on the night that Jose wanted to make up his own award and give an award out.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I don't mean in the afternoon of the awards ceremony, I mean during the evening.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The evening started at 8pm, and at about 9:30pm we got wind of the fact that Jose wanted to give out an award. Maybe it was earlier but it was halfway through the night.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It was the Jose Mourinho Player of the Season Award, which Scott McTominay won.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But with an award, you need a trophy.<br>
</p>
<p>
'So they ended up giving Scott McTominay a candlestick holder. It was long, silver and had a little bend in it  that was all they could find.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I don't know if Scott McTominay knows he won a candlestick holder.'<br>
</p>
<p>
McTominay was a regular performer during Mourinho's tenure, and has remained similarly integral under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick.<br>

</li><br>

It has been revealed that two clauses in his Old Trafford deal haven't been met</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The striker failed to earn 25 international caps for France between 2015-2019</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
His infamous Ballon d'Or clause, worth an extra 7.2million, hasn't materialised</b>
</li><br>
</ul>

By Daniel Davis For Mailonline </b>
<p>
Anthony Martial is yet to activate two clauses in his contract at Manchester United, including the infamous Ballon d'Or bonus, with his Old Trafford career on the rocks.<br>
</p>
<p>
Striker Martial has joined Sevilla on loan until the end of the season, with interim Red Devils boss Ralf Rangnick open to letting him leave in search of more game time.<br>
</p>
<p>
There is no option to permanently snap up the frontman after the short-term move, however, meaning that the 26-year-old may still look to reignite his United career.<br>
</p>
<p>
He moved to the club in 2015 from Monaco, after a huge 57.6million fee was splashed out on him - with 36m of that figure initially paid up front.<br>
</p>
<p>
The rest of the switch was made up of performance-related bonuses, which former Monaco vice presidentVadim Vasilyev described as being 'very realistic'.<br>
</p>
<p>
These bonuses totalled 21.6million and were made up of three clauses.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, it has today been pointed that just one of them has been activated over the seven years Martial has been a United player.<br>
</p>
<p>
With the ace having netted over 25 league goals for the team, between 2015 and 2019, United stumped up an extra 7.2m to Monaco.<br>
</p>
<p>
Another clause which may come into play is if Martial is capped 25 times for France while at United - an achievement they would again cough up an extra 7.2m for.<br>
</p>
<p>
Martial has failed to secure a regular starting berth on the international stage, though, having only played games for his country between his transfer and 2019.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lastly, Monaco also insisted on a Ballon d'Or clause for the deal, in a clear indication that they believed he would go on to be one of the best players in the world.<br>
</p>
<p>
If he had take home that coveted accolade, United would have been forced to fork out another 7.2m in bonuses.<br>
</p>
<p>
He missed out on the award between the four year period, though.<br>
</p>
<p>
Martial has made 269 appearances for the club to date, scoring 79 goals.<br>

<p>
Erling Haaland has revealed he has been watching a lot of videos of Leicester City forward Jamie Vardy as he is the 'best in the world' at running in behind the centre-back.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Borussia Dortmund striker has been in electric form once again this season, scoring 16 goals in 14 Bundesliga matches so far as he competes with Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski andBayer Leverkusen's Patrik Schick for the Golden Boot.<br>
</p>
<p>
But despite his excellent goalscoring form this term, Haaland has admitted there are still plenty of areas where he can improve - and uses videos of former England striker Vardy in his spare time to learn from the 35-year-old.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I've been, not studying, but watching a lot of players,' Haaland said in an interview with Sky Sports.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Let's take an example: the running in behind the centre-back when the No 10 has the ball. You maybe have the best in the world at that (in) Jamie Vardy, I've been looking a lot at him on exactly this.<br>
</p>
<p>
'That's how I am, I've always been watching a lot of football. I still do. When we play on Saturday, I go home and on Sunday I watch football all day. I've always liked football a lot.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Haaland, who scored 41 goals in 41 games for Dortmund last season, is expected to move clubs in 2022 as a 64million release clause becomes active in the summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Norwegian forward has netted 80 goals in 79 matches for the Bundesliga club since moving to Dortmund in a 20m transfer from Red Bull Salzburg.<br>
</p>
<p>
The likes of Manchester City, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Barcelona are strongly linked with a move for the 21-year-old, who admits he is not the finished product even though he spends a lot of time watching football to improve.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think I can improve on everything,' Haaland added. 'I can improve my finishing a lot, everything.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I can become faster, I can become stronger so I can improve that. But if I was to improve one thing, it's: don't be injured. Because if I'm not injured, I can play a lot more games and I can deliver even better.'<br>

<p>
Kieran Trippier has revealed that Tottenhamchairman Daniel Levy 'annoyed' him by offering him to other clubs a few months before his eventual exit - and hit out at the club for selling Mousa Dembele in 2019.<br>
</p>
<p>
The England international was sold to Atletico Madrid in a 20million deal in 2019 after four years at Spurs, with Trippier's form having dipped in north London.<br>
</p>
<p>
The defender, who has just completed a January transfer from Atleti to Newcastle, admitted that he was not at his best level during his final few months at Tottenham, but still took issue with Levy prematurely telling clubs about his availability.<br>
</p>
<p>
'As a footballer, you're trying to do your best and sometimes things don't go your way,' Trippier told The Athletic. 'It just wasn't happening, but I was still getting picked by Mauricio Pochettino.<br>
</p>
<p>
'After the Champions League final (loss to Liverpool), it felt like the right time to move on. The media weren't really on my side at the time and maybe I needed to get out of England for a bit just to clear my mind. I never looked back.<br>
</p>
<p>
'What annoyed me as you know, people in football speak and there are always rumours, but I know 100 per cent for a fact  and this is what I was most angry about  that two months before the end of the season, Daniel (Levy, the chairman) was offering me to other clubs.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I knew for certain that was happening, so I knew my time there must be up. I was playing for my team-mates and the supporters, but I also knew I wasn't wanted.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Trippier also spoke out about why he thinks Tottenham, who have yet to qualify for the Champions League since his departure, have been struggling both domestically and in Europe.<br>
</p>
<p>
The England international believes the January sale of Belgian midfielder Dembele to Chinese side Guangzhou - which happened a few months before Trippier's own departure - was a 'baffling' decision.<br>
</p>
<p>
'For me, the big one was selling Mousa Dembele that January,' he added. 'I think I can speak on behalf of the players who were there.<br>
</p>
<p>
'In the dressing room, he was an unbelievable person and all the lads loved him, but on the pitch he was the kind of player who would make a couple of per cent difference. That's what wins you things.<br>
</p>
<p>

Newcastle suffer a huge transfer blow with top target Diego Carlos set to STAY at Sevilla, with club chief Monchi revealing they rejected a 'very important and respectable offer' for the 40m-rated Brazilian</h2>

Sevilla believe Diego Carlos will stay at the club after rejecting a Newcastle offer</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Sporting director Monchi said the Magpies made a 'respectable' bid for Carlos</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The highly-regarded Brazilian is wanted by a number of top European clubs</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
But it appears Newcastle's reported 30million bid came too late in the window</b>

<p>
Sevilla sporting director Monchi believes Diego Carlos will now stay at the club after they rejected what he believes will be Newcastles final offer for the player.<br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking at a LaLiga club spotlight event Monchi said the first contact between Newcastle and Sevilla came a month ago. What he called a very important, respectable offer was then made which Sevilla rejected.<br>
</p>
<p>
Asked if the club feared a late bid that would be too good to turn down Monchi added: We last spoke three days ago. Both sides explained their position and we judged the negotiation to be closed and over. I dont foresee it reopening.<br>
</p>
<p>
He earlier joked that he was ready to take an early holiday having secured the arrival of Anthony Martial from Manchester United. That was an important signing, he said. Both because of the players quality and because of the club he was coming from.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sevilla are just four points off of leaders Real Madrid in the table and with so little time to find a replacement for Diego Carlos, Newcastles bid, believed to be in the region of 30million, was rejected, in part, because of its bad timing.<br>
</p>
<p>
Monchi admitted: the response might have been different had it been in the summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Asked if the big defender was angry at not being allowed to leave he joked: I saw him this morning and he looked happy. The size of him if he had been upset I might have had to change the decision.<br>
</p>
<p>
He is one of the top five three central defenders in Europe; certainly in the top three in Spain. I think maybe after [Real Madrids] David Alaba and Edu Militao there is no one better.<br>
</p>
<p>
Earlier Sevilla captain Ivan Rakitic said he believed the arrival of Anthony Martial could help the club keep Diego Carlos despite Newcastle offering to triple his wages.<br>
</p>
<p>
Martial joined on loan this week until the end of the season and Rakitic said: Anthony Martial [coming here] has shown that this is a big club where you can compete for everything. And if he can see it then so can the other players.<br>
</p>
<p>
I can understand those players [who have offers] but they know what they have here. These are young players they will have another window. Its harder to leave Sevilla now.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Sevilla captain also said he trusted Monchi to get the best result for the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
Monchi is the most important man at the club, said Rakitic. He lives it 24 hours. The first time he was signing me he spoke to me about games that I had played for Basel that even I couldnt remember!<br>
</p>
<p>
He knows what the team needs. He is not just signing players he is bringing people into his family.<br>

Newcastle are set to tie down 19-year-old starlet Joe White amid fears over losing the highly-rated midfielder on a free this summer with interest from Chelsea, Celtic, Rangers and Leeds</h2>

Joe White is believed to have agreed a new long-term deal with Newcastle</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The 19-year-old has been attracting interest from a number of other clubs</b>

<li><b>
The midfielder, who is highly-regarded, is yet to make his competitive debut</b>
</li><br>

By Craig Hope for MailOnline  </b>
<p>
Newcastle are set to secure the future of highly-rated midfielder Joe White after agreeing terms on a new contract.<br>
</p>
<p>
There was a danger the Magpies could lose the 19-year-old, whose current deal expires this summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Both Rangers and Celtic had shown an interest in White, while Premier League clubs including Chelsea, Leeds and Wolves were also monitoring his situation.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, Sportsmail understands the club have now negotiated a new, long-term contract with the England youth international.<br>
</p>
<p>
White is yet to make his competitive debut but has been training with Eddie Howes senior squad this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
He has been an unused substitute on several occasions and could now go out on loan in the coming days.<br>
</p>
<p>
Howe was extremely keen for the player to remain on Tyneside, and said last month: With Joe White, I've been very impressed. I saw him playing for the development squad recently, and he performed really well. He's a talented player.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Carlisle-born playmaker was also held in high esteem by former boss Steve Bruce, who handed him a first-team bow during pre-season.<br>
</p>
<p>
White is from good footballing stock. His late grandfather, Peter Hampton, made over 350 Football League appearances, starting his career at Leeds under Don Revie before representing Stoke, Burnley, Rochdale and Carlisle.<br>

Frank Lampard will hold more talks with Everton in latest twist to club's search for a new manager as Chelsea legend emerges as lead candidate to take over... with club stalling over Vitor Pereira amid fan backlash</h2>

Owner Farhad Moshiri is eager to make a 'forward-thinking' appointment</b>

<p>
Everton will hold further talks with Frank Lampard as the Chelsea legend emerges as a lead candidate to replace Rafa Benitez.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lampard has already held conversations with Goodison chiefs about the prospect of becoming the clubs new head coach.<br>
</p>
<p>
And those discussions will accelerate over the next 24 hours as Everton decide who they want to take over from sacked Benitez.<br>
</p>
<p>
No appointment is imminent, but if talks go well with Lampard the former England star could find himself in pole position to land the job ahead of Vitor Pereira.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sources claim the Toffees want someone in place before the weekend - particularly given the transfer window closes on Monday night.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pereira had emerged as Evertons No 1 choice to take the head coach vacancy, the former Porto boss arriving in England earlier this week to effectively seal his appointment.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, protests from supporters against his appointment has put Pereiras job hopes in jeopardy.<br>
</p>
<p>
Having spoken to Pereira, Sportsmail exclusively revealed on Wednesday that the Portuguese boss was saddened by the backlash against the clubs plans to name him as Benitezs replacement, causing the 52-year-old coach to consider withdrawing from the race altogether.<br>
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Pereira was compelled enough by the resistance towards his impending appointment that he took the unusual step of giving a telephone interview to Sky Sports News to openly discuss his involvement in Evertons process of recruiting a new boss.<br>
</p>
<p>
During the 20 minute interview on live TV, Pereira insisted he is still in the running for the job - but admitted he had been hurt by the resentment from supporters towards the possibility of him becoming head coach.<br>
</p>
<p>
Of course (it hurts), said Pereira.<br>
</p>
<p>
In my opinion, some of the critics are not for me. Because they dont know me very well, they dont know my work, they dont know me as a person, they dont know my CV.<br>
</p>
<p>
I work in a lot of countries, several clubs, several titles. Before you work with a person, you cannot judge.<br>
</p>
<p>
This is the first time in my career that I see this kind of thing. I never had in my career this kind of comment about me. My CV speaks for itself. I think these critics are not directed to me.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail revealed on Sunday that Pereira was emerging as a prime contender for the head coach vacancy at Goodison Park.<br>
</p>
<p>
But having emerged as the lead contender to replace Benitez, former Porto coach Pereiras chances of securing a dream job in the Premier League are now in the balance.<br>
</p>
<p>
The uncertainty has opened the door to Lampard to overtake Pereira as the leading candidate.<br>
</p>
<p>
It is understood that Lampard has strong support from sections of the Everton board, with CEO Denise Barrett-Baxendale said to be among those pushing the Chelsea legends claims.<br>
</p>
<p>
On his discussions with Everton, Pereira added: 'Yes of course (I want the job).<br>
</p>
<p>
'I have had a few interviews, not just one, more than one, with different people from the club. We discussed about everything, I discussed with different people in the club, on the board, I gave them my points of view on what I think about the club, about the team.<br>
</p>
<p>
'(I spoke with) Moshiri and (chairman) Bill Kenwright and other people in the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think they were enthusiastic (in) what I proposed.'<br>

<p>
Manchester United defender Harry Maguire has admitted his side's performances have been 'up and down a lot' this season as he issued a rallying call going into the second half of the campaign.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Red Devils are currently fourth in the Premier League table but Arsenal and Tottenham can go above them in the race for Champions League football if they win their games in hand.<br>
</p>
<p>
In another turbulent campaign for the club, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November after United won just one of their last seven league games under the Norwegian.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Old Trafford hierarchy brought in Ralf Rangnick as interim manager until the end of the season as their search for a new permanent manager continues with the German taking on a consultancy role in the summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
There has once again been fierce criticism of Maguire's performances, as well as the displays of the rest of the squad, and the England defender was quick to acknowledge that they'd been far from their best.<br>
</p>
<p>
While praising goalkeeper David de Gea, who has been the standout player again, in an interview with the club's official website, Maguire said: 'He [De Gea] has been amazing.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think a lot of people this year haven't had the most consistent of seasons, we've been up and down a lot, as outfielders and as a team performance.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Heaping more praise on the Spanish stopper, Maguire added:'But for sure David has been there, week in week out, producing big saves for us in big moments.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It doesn't surprise me because David is David, he's a world class goalkeeper.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Despite the gloom around Old Trafford,there is still optimism that United can salvage their season.<br>
</p>
<p>
They may be well out of the Premier League title race already but they can still secure a top-four finish and challenge for the FA Cup and Champions League.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Red Devils face a mouth-watering European last-16 tie against Paris Saint-Germain and have been drawn to play Middlesbrough in the FA Cup's fourth round.<br>
</p>
<p>
In an attempt to galvanise his team-mates and the club's supporters ahead of the restart of the domestic campaign next week, Maguire added: 'It's really important that we stay in the competitions for as long as we can and find ourselves challenging for trophies at the end of the season.<br>
</p>
<p>
'In two months' time we want to be challenging in the league, for the top four positions, and then in both competitions in the cups.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We are in a position where we are not happy with the league position, but for sure we have lots of things to play for, and lots of momentum to gain, and lots of things to improve on.<br>
</p>
<p>
'From now until the end of the season we have got to work together as a group, work together as a club and make sure we reach our aims.'<br>
</p>

Maguire was pictured out in Dubai earlier this week taking part in a golfing Pro-Am with England team-mate Jordan Pickford as they enjoy some time away from the pitch.<br>

<p>
Crystal Palace have accelerated their attempts to land Manchester United outcast Donny van de Beek on loan.<br>
</p>
<p>
The opportunity to sign the Holland star until the end of the season arose at the start of the week and Eagles chiefs have held internal talks about the possibility.<br>
</p>
<p>
And there is now significant hope at Selhurst Park that a deal for the creative midfielder can be successful in time for Monday's deadline.<br>
</p>
<p>
Talks between the two clubs are underway with United open to letting Van de Beek leave this month.<br>
</p>
<p>
Negotiations are said to have been positive, raising hope at the south London club that a deal - which would be one of the most eye-catching of the window - is possible.<br>
</p>
<p>
Palace were resigned to not making a signing this month but the opportunity to land the 24-year-old has seen the club shift into gear.<br>
</p>
<p>
Van de Beek has struggled for game time since arriving at Old Trafford in a deal worth 40million in 2020.<br>
</p>
<p>
He's made just four Premier League starts in that time and would now welcome the opportunity to play regular first-team football.<br>

<p>
Valerien Ismaelis under increasing pressure as West Bromwich Albion manager after a run of poor results with players unconvinced by his approach and methods.<br>
</p>
<p>
Supporters turned on the beleaguered boss during Wednesdays dire 2-0 home defeat by Preston, attacking Ismaels direct style of football and chanting the name of former manager Slaven Bilic.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ismael had already raised eyebrows by leaving out England goalkeeper Sam Johnstone following suggestions of a disagreement between the pair.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ismael reported as normal for training on Thursday yet Sportsmailunderstands a growing number of players are losing faith in him.<br>
</p>
<p>
Saturdays match at Millwall is starting to look hugely important for Ismael, whose side could fall out of the play-off places if they lose and results elsewhere go against them.<br>
</p>
<p>
Hundreds headed for the exits after Aston Villa loanee Cameron Archer scored Prestons second goal in the 76th minute and The Hawthorns was barely half-full by the final whistle.<br>
</p>
<p>
Despite a run of only one win in their last six, West Brom remain in the promotion hunt but they are heading in the wrong direction.<br>
</p>
<p>
Having targeted a top-two finish, fifth-placed Albion are seven points adrift of Blackburn in second and only two above Nottingham Forest in seventh.<br>
</p>
<p>
After arriving from Barnsley on a four-year deal in the summer, with about 2million going to the Yorkshire club in compensation, Ismael has not always had luck on his side.<br>
</p>
<p>
The club backed him by paying nearly 8million for Daryl Dike this month, only for the US forward to sustain a serious hamstring injury on his full debut.<br>
</p>
<p>
Many players were baffled at the omission of Johnstone, who has three caps for England and was available again after suspension.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 28-year-olds contract runs out in summer and this month represents Albions last chance to receive a transfer fee for him, unless he signs a new deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Other squad members feel they have been frozen out by Ismael, with Robert Snodgrass not involved since early November despite being one of the most experienced members of the squad.<br>

Arsenal's move for Juventus midfielder Arthur could collapse after they refused to sanction an 18 month loan.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arthur missed Juventus's first six games of the season due to injury but since then has only started five matches in Serie A having struggled to make an impact on the first-team.<br>
</p>
<p>
Juve though are reluctant to allow the former Barcelona star to depart without signing a replacement first, leaving any potential deal up in the air.<br>

The Gunners are also continuing their hunt for a striker, with Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin under consideration, although Borussia Dortmund are also monitoring the Toffees hitman as they brace for the potential loss of starman Erling Haaland in the summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Calvert-Lewin has missed much of the season due to a fractured toe and only returned to the Toffees' first-team this month having scored three goals in the first three games of the campaign.<br>

<p>
Argentina boss Lionel Scaloni has revealed that Lionel Messi is still suffering from the effects of having Covid, after he contracted the 'roughest variant' during the winter break.<br>
</p>
<p>
PSG superstar Messi has played just once this year after getting infected last month, making his return in the 4-0 win over Reims last weekend.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, Messi was not called up for Argentina's upcoming World Cup qualifiers with Chile and Colombia due to the fact that he was still not 100 per cent fully recovered from the virus, according to Scaloni.<br>
</p>
<p>
Scaloni, who will also not travel for the qualifiers after he contracted Covid himself, explained his captain's omission, withPaulo Dybala expected to be his replacement in the team's starting lineup.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I talked to (Messi) after he tested positive for COVID,' Scaloni told a press conference on Wednesday. 'It affected him a lot, he had the roughest variant.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It is important that he recovers, feels fit because there will be important moments ahead. I felt that it was not ideal for him to joins us [on international duty this weekend] not being at 100 per cent. He was affected for a some time.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Scaloni told reporters that his assistants Walter Samuel and Roberto Ayala will be in charge for the match. Argentina has already secured a spot at the tournament in Qatar, while Chile is still in contention.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I am well, recovered. But the PCR remains positive,' Scaloni added.<br>
</p>
<p>
The virus has also affected Chile, with defenders Mauricio Isla and Francisco Sierralta and winger Jean Meneses out.<br>

Brazil and Argentina have both qualified for the World Cup, with two more automatic spots up for grabs in South American qualifying.<br>

<p>
Chelsea's efforts to solve their left-back crisis have seen them have a 3m compensation offer to bring their own player back to Stamford Bridge rejected.<br>
</p>
<p>
According to The Athletic, Chelsea offered Lyon the money to cut Emerson's season-long loan with the French club in January, but they refused to accept the terms.<br>
</p>
<p>
It comes after Ben Chilwell was ruled out for the season due to an ACL injury.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 27-year-old Italy international Emerson was signed by Chelsea in 2018 from Roma for a fee in the region of 20m.<br>
</p>
<p>
Thomas Tuchel's side are still competing on four fronts this season, even if they are all but out of the Premier League title race sitting 10 points behind leaders Manchester City.<br>
</p>
<p>
They are in the final of the Carabao Cup, where they will face Liverpool at the end of February. They meet Plymouth in round four of the FA Cup and are Champions League holders - they face Lille in the round of 16.<br>
</p>
<p>
But in recent weeks, Chelsea's form has drifted and they are being reeled in by the chasing pack battling it out to finish fourth.<br>
</p>
<p>
United, who currently occupy the final Champions League spot, have two games in hand on Chelsea which if they win, would put them just three points behind.<br>

<p>
London rivals Tottenham have four games in hand on Chelsea due to Covid-19 postponements and four wins would take Antonio Conte's side above them.<br>

Review of club's financial position has convinced the EFL to extend that deadline</b>
</li><br>
</ul>

By Charlie Walker For Mailonline </b>
<p>
Derby County have been given a four-week stay of execution after the EFL agreed to extend the deadline for the club's administrators to show there are sufficient funds to complete the season.<br>
</p>
<p>
The club and the administrators, Quantuma, issued a joint statement on Thursday. It came after intensive meetings between the administrators and the three parties interested in taking over the club, which have so far failed to identify a preferred bidder.<br>
</p>
<p>
Derby had until February 1 - just five days away - to show the EFL it had enough funds to finish the season.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Following a formal review of revised financial forecasts at Derby County, the EFL and Quantuma (the Club Administrators) have today agreed a month-long extension to the deadline set for proof of funding to be provided,' the statement said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The EFL Board had previously requested evidence by 1 February 2022 of how Derby County was to be financed whilst it remained in administration, alongside a financial plan that determined how the Club would fulfil its fixture commitments until the end of the current season.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The EFL and Quantuma said the stay of execution would allow Derby to continue discussions with interested parties and provide 'additional time to seek clarity on the claims from Middlesbrough and Wycombe'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The compensation claims lodged by Middlesbrough and Wycombe insist Derbys breach of financial rules disadvantaged them. A key question here is whether the EFL will consider the rival clubs to be football creditors, in which case their claims would have to be paid in full, if successful. This has been a sticking point for interested parties.<br>
</p>
<p>
Today's statement came after local politicians and officials demanded a meeting with the EFL and Quantuma following days of frustration and 'radio silence'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Derbyshire MPs, led by Conservative Pauline Latham, want to meet both parties on Friday.<br>
</p>
<p>
The EFL and administrators have not said how the additional month will be funded, however, Derby has reduced its cost base with six players leaving during the January transfer window.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sources close to the negotiations have told Sportsmail that the administrators have sought additional lending from MSD Capital, which has already lent the club 20M secured against the ground and a further sum to pay the bills since it went into administration in September.<br>
</p>
<p>
Like many other creditors, MSD would have a lot to lose if Derby went bust.<br>
</p>
<p>
Hopes were raised on Friday with the emergence of a new bidder, US brothers Adam and Colin Binnie, who joined other interested parties, the consortium led by former Rams chairman Andy Appleby and ex-Newcastle United owner, Mike Ashley.<br>
</p>
<p>
Any takeover is complex since the club has debts of around 60M and the Pride Park Stadium is still in the possession of former owner, Mel Morris. And the outstanding claims from rival clubs complicate the matter further.<br>
</p>
<p>
As news of any further progress dried up this week, anxiety set in again among fans and political stakeholders. As reported in Sportsmail, it became clear as the days wore on that the club did not face a 'guillotine' if it missed the deadline of February 1 to prove it had funds for the rest of the season, as long as there was 'money in the meter' to keep the club limping along.<br>
</p>
<p>
On the pitch, under the direction of manager, Wayne Rooney, Derby have been battling against a 21-point deduction for financial rule breaches and for going into administration.<br>
</p>
<p>
Fans hope the 'Great Escape' is on, with the club now second bottom and eight points from safety, despite last week's defeat to Nottingham Forest.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, that may depend upon keeping hold of star player Tom Lawrence in what remains of the transfer window.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Rams have already reduced their costs by letting six players, Sam Baldock, David Marshall, Dylan Williams, Jordan Brown, Graeme Shinnie and Phil Jagielka, leave this month.<br>
</p>
<p>
A further option would be to sell Lawrence, who has been linked with Bournemouth and QPR, before the window closes on January 31. Not only is he the clubs highest earner, he could also command a significant fee.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lawrence has eight goals so far this season and has been in excellent form.<br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Derby fans have rallied to the cause and a crowd of 30,000 is expected for the Rams home game against Birmingham City on Sunday. A dozen wealthy supporters have also pledged to donate at least 10,000 each if it can buy the club some more precious time.<br>

Manchester United 'have put their search for a new manager on HOLD' after being impressed by interim boss Ralf Rangnick since he took charge in December... with Mauricio Pochettino and Erik ten Hag among those considered for the job</h2>

Ralf Rangnick has steadied the ship since taking charge at Manchester United</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Rangnick has helped United climb into the top four in impressive start as boss</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
United chiefs will now monitor his progress until the end of the season</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
A top four finish will boost his chances of taking over full-time in the summer</b>
</li><br>
</ul>

By Dan Ripley for MailOnline  </b>
<p>
Manchester United have reportedly put their search for a new manager on hold after being left impressed with the start Ralf Rangnick has made at the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
The German took charge on an interim basis in early December following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer a month earlier and has since steadied the ship at Old Trafford.<br>
</p>
<p>
United have played eight league games under his tenure, winning five and drawing twice, while during that period he has also guided them into the fourth round of the FA Cup.<br>
</p>
<p>
Rangnick's team have also been shored up defensively with four clean sheets from his 10 games and only conceding once in all but one of the other matches.<br>
</p>
<p>
Although United's performances have not left supporters too excited, he has guided the Red Devils back into contention for a Champions League place next term as the club heads into the winter break fourth in the table.<br>
</p>
<p>
According to the Sun, he could now be a contender to land the job on a full-time basis, especially if he secures Champions League qualification via the Premier League this term as the club's board monitor his progress until the end of the season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Rangnick entered a fractured dressing room and has shown little fear in dealing with some of the club's stars.<br>
</p>
<p>
He has not backed away from disputes with Cristiano Ronaldo, warning the star forward over showing his public frustrations having substituted him against Brentford recently.<br>
</p>
<p>
Rangnick has also been happy to start trimming a bloated squad, allowing fringe forward Anthony Martial to leave for Sevilla, initially on loan, while he has also given his blessing to allow Jesse Lingard to depart Old Trafford.<br>
</p>
<p>
United have a shortlist of candidates to appoint this summer including Paris Saint-Germain manager Mauricio Pochettino, Ajax boss Erik ten Hag, Sevilla's Julen Lopetegui and Spain coach Luis Enrique.<br>
</p>
<p>
Rangnick only arrived on a deal to take charge until the end of the season before moving to a consultancy role but has admitted interest in landing the job on a permanent basis.<br>
</p>
<p>
He said: 'Maybe if they ask my opinion and everything goes well and we develop the team I might even make the same recommendation to the board that I did at Leipzig twice when I recommended it might be a good idea to keep working with me for one year.'<br>

<p>
Southampton are interested in another Chelsea starlet, Tino Anjorin.<br>
</p>
<p>
Southampton are keen to agree a surprise permanent deal for attacking midfielder Anjorin this month.<br>
</p>
<p>
Following their takeover by Sport Republic earlier this month, Sportsmail reported that Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl hoped to add a goalkeeper and No 10 option to his squad in the summer but, with their new investment, those plans could be brought forward to the January window.<br>
</p>
<p>
Anjorin, 20, has now emerged as a target and Southampton are exploring the possibility of landing Anjorin before next Mondays transfer deadline.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 20 year-old is halfway through a loan to Russian Premier League side Lokomotiv Moscow who he joined last summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ralf Rangnick, Lokomotivs sports and development manager at the time was a key factor in the move but has since left to become Manchester Uniteds interim manager.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Russian season is currently on a break until the end of February while Anjorin is back at Chelsea recovering from a minor injury.<br>
</p>
<p>
Anjorin is due to return to Lokomotiv for the rest of the season but the two clubs can agree to end the agreement if it suits all parties.<br>
</p>
<p>
The link between Southampton and Chelsea has grown stronger over the last year.<br>
</p>
<p>
Southampton signed right-back Tino Livramento and centre-back Dynel Simeu from the Londoners and also took striker Armando Broja on loan.<br>
</p>
<p>
They would like Broja to extend his stay at St Marys though are relaxed about the situation as his loan does not expire until the end of the campaign.<br>
</p>
<p>
If they cant secure Anjorin this month they are also willing to revisit the situation at the end of the season.<br>

<h2>
DOMINIC KING: The madcap world of Farhad Moshiri is truly a masterclass in how NOT to run a football club he's allowed Vitor Pereira and his loose lips to turn Everton into a laughing stock</h2>

<ul><li><b>
Farhad Moshiri's reign in charge of Everton has not gone as supporters hoped</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Moshiri is on the search for another manager after sacking Rafael Benitez</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Everton fans are angry at the prospect of Vitor Pereira as his possible successor</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Frank Lampard hasn't worked for a year but Pereira has been vocal about the job</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<b>
By Dominic King for the Daily Mail  </b>
<p>
Duringone of Everton's recent searches for a manager, the unpredictable nature of Farhad Moshiri caused increased exasperation within Goodison Park.<br>
</p>
<p>
One day, he would have a certain target and ask for it to be pursued. Progress would be made to deliver the majority shareholder's wish but - when it came to the point where a button needed to be pushed - Moshiri would unexpectedly change his mind and tack.<br>
</p>
<p>
At first glance, you might think such information was far-fetched. But after the last farcical turn in this soap opera, involving a job candidate being interviewed about his interview on live TV, do not doubt. The madcap world of Moshiri, truly, is a masterclass in how not to run a football club.<br>
</p>
<p>
Vitor Pereira was flown into London earlier this week with the expectation he would become Everton's new manager. He wasn't good enough to get the job in 2013 or 2019 but, for some reason, Moshiri - perhaps swayed by an outside influence - felt 2022 was the right time.<br>
</p>
<p>
Everton's fans, however, didn't. Some graffiti was daubed on the walls of Goodison, the image was circulated on social media and fury blazed.<br>
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Moshiri had cold feet, there was no appointment and this rudderless outfit were back to square one. It was remarkable to hear Pereira singing like a canary on Sky Sports News - what a stroke of luck that he just happened to be on the end of a phone for them for a spot of self-promotion - but it would be even more remarkable if Moshiri handed him the reins now.<br>
</p>
<p>
At this juncture, Frank Lampard has become favourite for the role. If he does get it, no doubt there will be some faff on official club channels from Moshiri saying the former Chelsea boss was always the man he wanted.<br>
</p>
<p>
If that happens, treat every word with ridicule. Lampard has been out of work for a year. He has not been in hiding, he has not had some extortionate escape clause, he has not been in a job that would require delicate negotiations. He has been available, itching to get back on the training ground.<br>
</p>
<p>
A club with foresight would have had a deal in place to get Lampard unveiled within 48 hours of Rafa Benitez's dismissal, but no. This is Everton, making it up on the hoof and constantly taking wrong turns down blind alleys. It never used to be this way.<br>
</p>
<p>
The fans are mutinous and chairman Bill Kenwright bore the brunt of it on Saturday. It was desperate to see him confronted, unable to get a word in edgeways as the angry mob jabbered their fury.<br>
</p>
<p>
This history lesson won't be well received by those who are so blind with rage but when Kenwright and then manager David Moyes worked in tandem, Everton were widely respected, did outstanding deals for hungry, young players and constantly pushed forward.<br>
</p>
<p>
Over Moyes' 11 seasons from 2002 to 2013, Everton reached Europe four times, finishing outside the top eight twice. At one stage, Moyes felt he had the basis of a team who may have had a dart at the title and had he signed Edin Dzeko from Wolfsburg in 2010, maybe broken into the top four.<br>
</p>
<p>
Here was what Everton should be - united from boardroom to the pitch, fans committed to ambitious players who are proud to wear their colours. Moshiri has thrown money around and made it a place where there is little soul, losing sight of what is important.<br>
</p>
<p>
That they are in a place where Pereira and his loose lips turned them into a laughing stock - people within Goodison had no knowledge it was coming and were gobsmacked by what he said - was nothing short of a disgrace. Moshiri needs to make a good decision. History tells you he won't.<br>

<p>
Everton's misery has been compounded after the club sustained another injury blow as Abdoulaye Doucoure has been ruled out for at least a month.<br>
</p>
<p>
The midfielder was forced off in the 65th minute of the Toffees 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa at Goodison Park last Saturday.<br>
</p>
<p>
The club confirmed that the 29-year-old underwent tests following the game which revealed he had sustained a groin injury and will require a period of rehabilitation for a minimum of four weeks.<br>
</p>
<p>
Fabian Delph has also been sidelined after picking up a thigh injury during training this week which will also rule him out for at least four weeks.<br>
</p>
<p>
Everton are continuing their search for a new managers after the dismissal of Rafa Benitez earlier this month.<br>
</p>
<p>
Caretaker manager Duncan Ferguson is currently at the helm but whoever arrives at Goodison to take charge as permanent boss is set to face a midfield injury crisis.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Toffees are already without Tom Davies, who underwent successful surgery on a hamstring injury earlier this month after sustaining the problem at the end of December.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Blues' latest injury blow leaves them thin on options in the middle of the park for their FA Cup Fourth Round tie with Brentford and a crunch clash against Newcastle.<br>
</p>
<p>
The club's next manager first request to the board could be a new midfielder as soon as possible to combat their crisis.<br>

<p>
Reece James is set to return to Chelsea first-team action in time for the Blues' FIFA Club World Cup campaign at the start of next month, according to reports.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 22-year-old defender has been missing since the end of December after picking up a hamstring problem during a 1-1 draw at Brighton.<br>
</p>
<p>
England international James has been a key figure for Thomas Tuchel's side this season, scoring four goals and registering five assists in his 16 Premier League games to date so far.<br>
</p>
<p>
And according to The Athletic, James will return to first-team training in just under a fortnight as he looks to put his recent injury woes behind him.<br>
</p>
<p>
James has missed Chelsea's last four Premier League matches but the Blues' chances of challenging Manchester City for the Premier League title have evaporated in that time.<br>
</p>
<p>
A run of just two victories in eight games has seen Tuchel's side slip ten points behind reigning champions City having played a game more than Pep Guardiola's side.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tuchel has been reliant on club captain Cesar Azpilicueta in the right-back role in James' absence, while Callum Hudson-Odoi can be used at wing back, but he has been used in more attacking areas in recent weeks.<br>
</p>
<p>
News of James' reported imminent return is good news for Chelsea who can still win four cup competitions this season, despite their flailing attempts in the Premier League.<br>
</p>
<p>
Before heading out to Abu Dhabi for the Club World Cup, which begins for the Blues on February 9, Chelsea host League One side Plymouth Argyle in the fourth round of the FA Cup, while they also take on Liverpool in the EFL Cup final that same month.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea will also be looking to begin the knockout defence of their Champions League title in February, as Tuchel's side host French champions Lille in the last-16. James will also be focusing his attention of keeping his spot in Gareth Southgate's England squad ahead of two March friendlies for the Three Lions.<br>
</p>
<p>
Southgate's squad host Switzerland and the Ivory Coast next month, with James competing with the likes of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kieran Tripper and Kyle Walker for a starting spot.<br>

<p>
FIFA have said the Club World Cup, due to take place in Abu Dhabi next month, will still go ahead as planned despite the major esculations between Yemen and the United Arab Emirates in the last week.<br>
</p>
<p>
It comes days after the UAE confirmed that it had intercepted and destroyed two ballistic missiles over Abu Dhabi that were fired by Yemen's Houthi rebels.<br>
</p>
<p>
The clashes are part of a major escalation in the seven-year war after the Huthis, following a series of territorial defeats, launched a deadly drone-and-missile attack on the UAE last week, killing three civilians.<br>
</p>
<p>
The attacks on the UAE have now raised doubts over February's Club World Cup, which pits the winners of major club tournaments from around the world against each other.<br>
</p>
<p>
Premier League side and Champions League winners Chelsea are due to take part in the tournament that is scheduled between February 3 and February 12.<br>
</p>
<p>
But despite the esculation out in the Middle East, FIFA have said the tournament will still go ahead but is 'monitoring the situation'.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2021 will be hosted as planned,' a FIFA spokesperson told Al Jazeera.<br>
</p>
<p>
'When it comes to security at the FIFA Club World Cup UAE 2021, FIFA is continuing to monitor the situation and working closely with the Local Organising Committee, and other key stakeholders in the UAE, regarding security arrangements for the tournament.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The seven-team tournament, which is held across two venues in Abu Dhabi, will be kicked off by host team Al Jazira Club andTahitis AS Pirae, who replaced Auckland City after the New Zealand side pulled out due to Covid regulations.<br>
</p>
<p>
AL Ahly, Monterrey, Al Hilal and Palmeiras all complete the line up along with Thomas Tuchel's side, who are due to fly out to the UAE capital in the coming days.<br>
</p>
<p>
Hundreds of thousands have been killed and millions displaced in the conflict, which the United Nations has labelled the world's worst humanitarian crisis.<br>
</p>
<p>
Yemen's Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, claimed on Monday they had launched the attack on the UAE, without elaborating.<br>
</p>
<p>
The UAE has been at war in Yemen since early 2015, and was a key member of the Saudi-led coalition that launched attacks against the Iranian-backed Houthis after the group overran the capital of Yemen and ousted the internationally backed government from power.<br>
</p>
<p>
Although the UAE has decreased the number of troops it has on the ground since 2019, it continues to be actively engaged in the war and supports key militias fighting the Houthis. It also cooperates closely with the United States in counter-terrorism operations in Yemen.<br>
</p>
<p>
Following last week's attack, video footage from Abu Dhabi showed a black plume of smoke rising up into the sky from the area of one of the reported drone attacks.<br>
</p>
<p>
A full investigation has been launched, the police said, without identifying the wounded.<br>
</p>
<p>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been at war in Yemen since early 2015, and was a key member of the Saudi-led coalition that launched attacks against the Iranian-backed Shiite Houthi rebels after the group overran the capital of Yemen and ousted the internationally backed government from power.<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
UAE and its allies believe the Houthis are tools for Iran to seize control of Yemen, though the Houthis deny they are backed by Tehran.<br>
</p>
<p>
Although the UAE has decreased the number of troops it has on the ground since 2019, it continues to be actively engaged in the war and supports key militias fighting the Houthis. It also cooperates closely with the United States in counter-terrorism operations in Yemen.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pro-coalition forces backed by the UAE have recently joined fighting against the Houthis in Yemen's energy-producing regions of Shabwa and Marib.<br>
</p>
<p>
Yemen's government-aligned forces, aided by the UAE-backed Giants Brigades and with help from Saudi airstrikes, reclaimed the entire southern province of Shabwa from the Houthis earlier this month and made advances in nearby Marib province.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Houthis have claimed previous attacks on Abu Dhabi's airport, as well as the emirate's Barakah nuclear power plant - claims that Emirati officials have denied in the past.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Houthis have used bomb-laden drones to launch crude and imprecise attacks aimed at Saudi Arabia and the UAE over the course of the war. The group has also launched missiles at Saudi airports, oil facilities and pipelines, as well as used booby-trapped boats for attacks in key shipping routes.<br>
</p>
<p>
The ongoing conflict in Yemen, now in its seventh year, pushed the small nation into a humanitarian crisis that has cost tens of thousands of lives and forced millions of people onto the brink of starvation.<br>
