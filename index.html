<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/15/46865783-0-image-a-57_1629385161332.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
The final shortlist for the UEFA Men's Player of the Year has been revealed, with Chelsea and Manchester City dominating proceedings.<br>
</p>
<p>
Both Champions League finalists boast players which make up the final three places for the prestigious award, with Jorginho, N'Golo Kante and Kevin De Bruyne set to battle it out for the honour.<br>
</p>
<p>
The three midfielders have been given the nod ahead of Lionel Messi and each received more votes, despite the 34-year-old's sublime final season with Barcelona and his triumphs with the Argentina national team.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kevin De Bruyne - (Man City & Belgium)<br>
</p>
<p>
Jorginho - (Chelsea & Italy)<br>
</p>
<p>
N'Golo Kante - (Chelsea & France)<br>
</p>
<p>
final vote standing will be revealed on Thursday, August 26 when the winner will receive the award<br>
</p>
<p>
4. Lionel Messi (Barcelona, now PSG & Argentina) – 148 points<br>
</p>
<p>
5. Robert Lewandowski (Bayern & Poland) – 140 points<br>
</p>
<p>
6. Gianluigi Donnarumma (AC Milan, now at Paris & Italy) – 49 points<br>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
9. Cristiano Ronaldo (Juventus & Portugal) – 16 points<br>
</p>
<p>
10. Erling Haaland (Dortmund & Norway) – 15 points<br>
</p>
<p>
The final three players were determined by a voting jury comprising 24 coaches of the teams that participated in this summer's Euros, along with 80 coaches of the clubs that participated in the group stages of last season's Champions League (32) and UEFA Europa League (48).<br>
</p>
<p>
In addition, 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group were also permitted to cast their vote on the subject, one from each of UEFA's member associations.<br>
</p>
<p>
Voters selected their top three players, with the first receiving five points, the second three and the third one. <br>
</p>
<p>
As part of the rules coaches were not allowed to vote for players from their own team.<br>
</p>
<p>
A full run-down of the players was released by the football body, with the rest of the top 10 revealed.<br>
</p>
<p>
The players who missed out, in placed order were: Messi, Robert Lewandowski, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Kylian Mbappe, Raheem Sterling, Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland. <br>
</p>
<p>
UEFA announced both their men's and women's shortlist on Thursday, with Emma Hayes going up for the Coach of the Year award.<br>
</p>
<p>
For the men's Coach of the Year, both Thomas Tuchel and Pep Guardiola will do battle for the big honour, along with Italy's Euro 2020 winning manager Roberto Mancini.<br>
</p>
<p>
As is now customary, UEFA also named the nominees for their individual playing positions for the past season.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Goalkeeper of the Year award will be contested between Thibaut Courtois, Ederson and Edouard Mendy.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea and City once again dominate the defenders category, with Cesar Azpilicueta battling against team-mate Antonio Rudiger and Ruben Dias.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Midfielder of the Year award is naturally a straight replica of the main Player of the Year running, with De Bruyne, Jorginho and Kante again facing off.<br>
</p>
<p>
Bayern Munich's goalscoring machine Robert Lewandowski is the clear favourite for the strikers award, with Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappe also in the running.<br>
</p>
<p>
A specific award will also focus on last season's Europa League campaign, to reward the player who performed best in UEFA's second tier European competition.<br>
</p>
<p>
After Manchester United surged to the final and met Villarreal in Gdansk, both sides naturally boast players in the final three.<br>

<h2>
Inside Jose Mourinho's Roma revolution: Faith in £34m Abraham to fill the Dzeko void, clearing the air with Mkhitaryan after their fall-out and making fans fall for the 'new Pope' with a promise of wins</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/12/46816287-0-image-a-59_1629285454962.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Jose Mourinho starts life as the manager of Roma in with a Europa Conference League clash against Trabzonspor on Thursday night.<br>
</p>
<p>
It will be his first competitive game since leaving Tottenham earlier this year and he will be hoping to get off to the perfect start as he bids to get Roma back into the Champions League.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mourinho has already had a major impact in the 'Eternal City'. He has signed Tammy Abraham from Chelsea for £34million and proven to be a hit with supporters, who are desperate for success.<br>
</p>
<p>
Here, Sportsmail looks at how Mourinho has spent the summer trying to transform the club as they kick off their campaign. <br>
</p>
<p>
An upgrade on Fonseca<br>
</p>
<p>
Rome is a city surrounded in history and political jostling and Mourinho is seen as the perfect man to build a new empire on the Sampietrini.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mourinho is already considered to be better than predecessor Paulo Fonseca in managing a squad of star names during difficult times. <br>
</p>
<p>
Mourinho knows he will be without Leonardo Spinazzola for the first few months of the season after the Achilles problem he suffered at Euro 2020 but he has told his team to fully focus on their performances so the Italian's absence isn't too harmful.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 58-year-old's greatest attribute is knowing how to speak to and motivate his players, which was a huge problem for Fonseca.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mourinho is smart, intelligent and above all is willing and able to protect his team in moments of difficulty. His brand of football is not easy on the eye but Mourinho is a winner.<br>
</p>
<p>
In that sense he is compared in Italy to former England manager Fabio Capello, who in Rome won a historic Scudetto. <br>
</p>
<p>
Roma have chosen an experience head on the bench but Mourinho knows he has work to do to salvage his reputation after tough times at Tottenham and Manchester United. <br>
</p>
<p>
Placing faith in Abraham <br>
</p>
<p>
Abraham completed his £34m move to Roma earlier this week and the English striker is considered to be the ideal player to revive the club's ambitions.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mourinho has spent a lot of money in the transfer market this summer - more than rivals AC Milan, Inter, Napoli and Juventus - as he plans to launch an assault on the Champions League places. It highlights Roma's lofty ambitions.<br>
</p>
<p>
Abraham has great physical and technical qualities and he should be targeting at least 15 goals in Serie A in his debut campaign.<br>
</p>
<p>
That figure is definitely within the reach of a young striker who has experienced exciting moments in the Premier League.<br>
</p>
<p>
Roma needed to replace veteran Edin Dzeko and signed a striker Mourinho rates highly. He is young, determined and has plenty of experience already, despite his age.<br>
</p>
<p>
Compared to the Bosnian, Abraham is faster and much more mobile, which is key for the way Mourinho wants his Roma team to play.<br>
</p>
<p>
Abraham has already chosen the No 9 shirt, which in Rome has a very important value because it was worn by Abel Balbo, Gabriel Batistuta and Vincenzo Montella. <br>
</p>
<p>
In Rome everyone is already affectionately calling him 'Tammy' and there is a huge spotlight on him. Abraham is the only name Mourinho wanted at the centre of his Roma attack and it's hoped his Premier League experience will help him seamlessly slot in in Italy.<br>
</p>
<p>
Giving the capital belief once more<br>
</p>
<p>
Mourinho seems to have already won the hearts of Roma supporters, earning the nickname 'the new Pope'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Not dressed in white but in the colours of the Giallorossi, he is the star of the show who has the unenviable task of giving a city that lives and breathes football hope that they can challenge for trophies again.<br>
</p>
<p>
Locals are constantly talking about Mourinho. Whether it be in front of newsstands, on the Piazza Navona or in front of the Trevi Fountain, every corner of the city is excited by the arrival of Mourinho and what his Roma team will look like.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ever single district of the city is starting to fly Roma flags and fans are starting to rediscover their love for Roma, who have left the fans hugely disappointed in recent seasons. <br>
</p>
<p>
At 16 Birra brewery, in Via di Porta Furba, fans can enjoy a taste of the 'Specialone' IPA while the 'Pizza Mourinho' has already been created by a local restaurant. <br>
</p>
<p>
Mourinho was also depicted in a mural in the historic Testaccio district of Rome aboard a 'Special One' Vespa with a scarf in Roma's iconic colours around his neck.  <br>
</p>
<p>
He has also been the focus of a new painting exhibited in the Rione Monti, which depicts the Special One as a saint of the Catholic Church on a yellow and red background on Via Urbana.<br>
</p>
<p>
At long last, Mourinho appears to finally be recovering that media appeal that he had lost in recent years after several disappointments in English football. <br>
</p>
<p>
Desperate for success now <br>
</p>
<p>
Roma's recent Serie A campaigns have showed they are a good team but still have work to do if they are to challenge the likes of Juventus and Inter for the title. <br>
</p>
<p>
It will be up to the 'Special One' to be able to harness the passion of the city and transform it into energy for the club to thrive off.<br>
</p>
<p>
He will want ample freedom of communication and will have to do everything to try to help the club return to the summit after years of disappointment. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Friedkin family, the Roma owners, have bet big on him and now hope their decision to hire Mourinho and spend big in the transfer market will bring the club back to the top.<br>
</p>
<p>
Roma are definitely a candidate for a place in the top four but face competition from the likes of Atalanta, AC Milan, Napoli and Lazio.<br>
</p>
<p>
A return to the Champions League is essential, however, if the club are to obtain more financial resources to improve for the future. <br>
</p>
<p>
Clear the air talks with Mkhitaryan<br>
</p>
<p>
Not only has Mourinho brought in some exciting new players this summer but he's also tried to build bridges with his existing stars.<br>
</p>
<p>
Last month Henrikh Mkhitaryan insisted he has buried the hatchet with his new boss after friction between the pair when they were both at Manchester United.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Armenian had previously spoken of 'differences and conflicts' between himself and the Portuguese manager when at Old Trafford but Mkhitaryan, who has decided to stay at the club despite several offers, insisted that is now in the past <br>
</p>
<p>
He told Corriere dello Sport: 'What happened in Manchester stays there. We spoke as mature people, we both want to go down the same path, we both want to win something with Roma and that is the only thing that matters this year.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Mkhitaryan, 32, agreed a one-year contract extension in July after his chat with Mourinho. He enjoyed a successful 2020-21 campaign, scoring 15 goals and adding 13 assists.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I had no doubts. But I wanted to have a fresh head to make the best decision. I had other offers, in Italy and abroad, but the right decision was to stay,' he added. <br>

<h2>
Barcelona have offered Philippe Coutinho Lionel Messi's coveted No 10 shirt and are keen for him to stay this summer, despite the cash-strapped LaLiga giants being desperate to shift players to ease £1.15BILLION debt</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/14/46863573-0-image-a-4_1629381345117.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Barcelona have communicated to Philippe Coutinho that they view him as an important member of their squad - and have even discussed giving the playmaker the club's coveted No 10 shirt.<br>
</p>
<p>
Coutinho's future has been called into question this summer and he has been linked with a move away from the Nou Camp; Arsenal among the clubs connected with the 29-year-old.<br>
</p>
<p>
But the Spanish giants want the former Liverpool star to remain in Catalonia this summer, a stance the player is aware of.<br>
</p>
<p>
Indeed, it is understood that Coutinho has been offered the club's historic No 10 squad number - which has just been vacated by the legendary Lionel Messi.<br>
</p>
<p>
Coutinho was assigned the No 14 shirt by Barca last season, making as many appearances under Ronald Koeman.<br>
</p>
<p>
The midfielder was stripped of his shirt number earlier last week amid reported interest from Lazio as his No 14 was given to Rey Manaj, who has been promoted from the B team. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Brazilian is still to be given a squad number this season, but the prospect of taking Messi's No 10 jersey isn't something that necessarily appeals to Coutinho.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lazio were reported to be interested in a loan move for Coutinho with the option to buy him permanently thereafter for £25million.<br>
</p>
<p>
While Barcelona were looking to offload the Brazilian in a swap deal with Arsenal that would see the Gunners captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang arrive at the Nou Camp, according to reports by Sky Sports.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it appears Barca are keen to keep hold of the attacking midfielder ahead of the transfer deadline on August 31.<br>

<h2>
REVEALED: German giants Borussia Dortmund TURNED DOWN their edition of Puma's controversial badge-less third kits after fans moaned about 'leaked' shirt... and now Man City fans are dubbing theirs the 'worst ever!'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/13/46860701-0-image-a-2_1629376850231.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Borussia Dortmund rejected Puma's controversial third kit design as it removed the club's badge from the front of the player's shirts.     <br>
</p>
<p>
Puma have described the design as 'progressive' and have opted for a similar layout on Manchester City and AC Milan's shirts this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, unlike the reigning Premier League champions, Dortmund made the decision to turn down Puma's design after fans moaned about the 'leaked' shirt on social media. <br>
</p>
<p>
Puma and BVB first joined forces during the 2012-2013 Bundesliga season and signed a long-term partnership extension in 2019 that will see them work together until 2027. <br>
</p>
<p>
Puma's shirt designs have always been a topic of controversy with the Dortmund fans, but their latest creation has caused quite a stir.<br>
</p>
<p>
The jersey - which was leaked on Twitter - marked a departure from the traditional uniform sported by clubs around the world. <br>
</p>
<p>
Dortmund's badge did not feature prominently on the front of the shirt and their name was used instead. Puma also emphasised Dortmund's partner, Evonik,  across the front of the jersey. <br>
</p>
<p>
Fans took to social media to voice their opinions over the shirt, with many saying it was 'the worst' kit design they had ever seen. <br>
</p>
<p>
One fan wrote: 'Almost all of the jerseys from the last few years are not nice. There are tons of fan made jerseys that look better than the ones that a well-paid Puma designer makes.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Another added: 'Enough with Puma, the jerseys are always the same only minimal changes.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Another Tweeted: 'Something like that has to be criticised. It would be nice if the employees in the relevant positions had even a little idea of what Borussia Dortmund is and what it means.'<br>
</p>
<p>
While one user wrote: 'Why can't Puma let the fans vote on it? It was possible in Dusseldorf. To avoid manipulation you decide 1/3 fans, 1/3 BVB, 1/3 Puma.'<br>
</p>
<p>
As a result, Dortmund released a statement on Twitter that read: 'Fans, your criticism of the cup jersey for the new season has been received. The leaked jersey doesn't look what it will look like. So please be patient.'    <br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Manchester City officially unveiled their ground-breaking new third kit on Wednesday. <br>
</p>
<p>
Taking on a navy blue sheen, the general look of the design appears simple enough, but closer inspection reveals their badge dotted about the shirt. <br>
</p>
<p>
And in its place, the words 'Man City' are emblazoned across the front in sky blue, with the Puma logo and Etihad Airways sponsor above and below respectively. <br>
</p>
<p>
The crest in its usual form has been moved to the back of the neck, and the shirt is accompanied by navy blue shorts and similarly coloured socks. <br>
</p>
<p>
Revealing the concept for the first time, Puma explained that they aimed to 'challenge convention, innovate, and bring fresh products to football'.<br>
</p>
<p>
In a statement, they said the kit 'creates a new expression of the club's identity on the front of the jersey by reimagining the traditional football kit in a brand-new approach merging football and streetwear culture.'<br>
</p>
<p>
They have also revealed all on the benefits of the kit, with its unique design helping to keep athletes 'dry and comfortable' as well as enhance 'breathability'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Carl Tuffley, senior head of design manager Teamsport, said their objective was to go against the 'traditional football jersey design'. <br>
</p>
<p>
He added: 'It is easy to play safe, but we want to change perceptions of a conventional football jersey. The Third kit presented an opportunity to be bold, so we wanted to re-energise these jerseys and take a new direction.' <br>
</p>
<p>
AC Milan have also been seen repping the same design as City's, albeit in a black colour'.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Olivier Giroud was pictured sporting it for the release  - showing off the design that features the words AC Milan across the front. <br>

<h2>
Patrick Bamford is 'one of the best strikers in English football' in the eyes of Marcelo Bielsa - and Leeds boss wants to secure 27-year-old's long-term future at Elland Road with new deal</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/17/46868983-0-image-a-7_1629390160515.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Patrick Bamford has set his sights on firing Leeds into Europe after signing a new five-year contract with the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 27-year-old, who scored 17 goals in the Premier League last season, was into the final year of his original deal at Elland Road and had attracted interest from Tottenham.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Bamford has ended speculation over his future by agreeing fresh terms to keep him at Leeds until 2026.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I know that Leeds want to get back to where they were and hopefully reach Europe at some point, and that is my ambition as well,' said Bamford.<br>
</p>
<p>
'This is not the kind of club where we are in the Premier League and we are happy, we are striving for the next step. You have always got to be looking towards something.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I remember the days when Leeds were in Europe and they were a team everyone was frightened of. That is what the fans have been used to and is something that will keep pushing us on and we will strive towards.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Bamford joined Leeds in a £10million transfer from Middlesbrough in 2018. He has made 111 appearances for the club, scoring 43 goals.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Patrick is a very important player for us,' said United boss Marcelo Bielsa. 'He is one of the best strikers that English football has.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Bamford added: 'There has not been many times in my career where I have been as settled as I am now. It was important for me to get this tied down and concentrate on the season ahead.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I have improved no end under Marcelo. I have struck up that rapport with the fans and I am enjoying every minute of it.'<br>

<h2>
Meet Barcelona's 'BABY team'! Spanish paper looks to the next generation at the Nou Camp as Ronald Koeman is tasked with nurturing Ansu Fati, Pedri, Yusuf Demir and Co in post-Lionel Messi era</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/11/46857611-0-image-m-22_1629370303931.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Barcelona's youngsters will be tasked with leading the club into the post-Lionel Messi era according to the Spanish press.<br>
</p>
<p>
Messi signed a two-year contract with Paris Saint-Germain after leaving Barcelona this summer due to LaLiga's financial fair play rules.<br>
</p>
<p>
Now, Barcelona must look to fill the void left by the Argentine international who scored the most goals, made the most appearances and won the most titles in the club's history. <br>
</p>
<p>
Barcelona have been forced to restructure their team following the departure of Messi this summer. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Catalan giants shared a bombshell statement earlier this month saying the 34-year-old would not be staying at the club due to financial restrictions placed upon them by LaLiga. <br>
</p>
<p>
The news came as a blow to not only the fans but the player himself as he believed a long-term deal, albeit on lower pay terms, had been agreed and that he would meet up with his teammates to resume training ahead of the 2021-2022 season. <br>
</p>
<p>
The club have since been left with a hole in the squad that must be filled. However, Barcelona president Joan Laporta recently highlighted the club's 'worrying' amount of debt and explained how they were unable to afford new players. <br>
</p>
<p>
With £1.15bn worth of debt weighing the club down, the Catalan giants must turn to the young players in their squad to step up for the 2021-2022 season.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Mundo Deportivo says the onus falls on Ronald Koeman to guide the 'exciting young group' of Barcelona players to victory this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Spanish outlet, who referred to Barcelona's next generation as the 'Baby Team', believe the likes of Pedri, Ansu Fati and Alejandro Balde will be at the forefront of Barcelona's starting XI.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Pedri has been identified as the best fit to lead the club into the post-Lionel Messi era. It is his wholesome love of the game and his memorising skill set that has made him the club's new poster-boy. <br>
</p>
<p>
The teenage midfielder who lit up the Euros for Spain and then went to Japan to represent his country at the Olympics played an astonishing 73 games last season – that's more than Neymar has managed in his two last seasons at Paris Saint-Germain. <br>
</p>
<p>
He demonstrated the same impish spark that Messi had when he first played for Barcelona and has drawn similarities to that of Andres Iniesta.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 18-year-old has the close control and balance to get him out of tight spots and into space. He plays a fast-paced brand of football that will ignite Barcelona's attack during the 2021-22 season. <br>
</p>
<p>
 Fati has been named as another Barcelona player who has what it takes to fill the void left by Messi this summer.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Fati has broken countless records since coming on for Carles Perez in the 78th minute of a 5-2 win over Betis in August 2019. <br>
</p>
<p>
Just six days after making his senior debut, Fati become Barca's youngest LaLiga goalscorer against Osasuna at El Sadar. He found the back of the net by converting Perez's cross at just 16 years and 304 days old.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Since then he has become Barca's youngest Champions League debutant, the youngest goalscorer in Champions League history and the youngest goalscorer at the Nou Camp. <br>
</p>
<p>
As a result, Fati will be one of the first academy graduates to secure regular spot in the Barcelona first team since Sergi Roberto - who made his debut in November 2010 during Copa del Rey match against Ceuta. <br>
</p>
<p>
Pablo Paez, otherwise known as Gavi, has also been named as a potential replacement for Messi as he more than comfortable playing as a classic No 10. <br>
</p>
<p>
Having signed from Real Betis in 2015, Gavi can also operate as part of a three-man midfield to suit a 4-3-3 formation.  <br>
</p>
<p>
His style of play has also been likened to that of Iniesta, with many claiming the 17-year-old will hit the same level of stardom as the former Barcelona legend. <br>
</p>
<p>
While left-back Balde has been labelled as a potential replacement for Barcelona defender Jordi Alba. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 17-year-old started his career as a striker but has slowly moved his way further back. However, it is attacking instincts that make him such a formidable defender. <br>
</p>
<p>
The youngster possesses the power, pace and attacking mindset to initiate Barcelona's attack and link up with Fati down the left-hand side. The combination of such qualities make him the perfect modern defender and a real asset to Koeman's team.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Ronald Araujo is another Barcelona youngster that will be handed the torch this season. The 22-year-old has been named as the long-term successor to Gerard Pique. <br>
</p>
<p>
Araujo has delivered a defensive masterclass for the Catalan giants following  Pique's ligament injury and will look to continue such form during the 2021-22 season. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 22-year-old, who was part of the Uruguay squad that made it to the quarter-finals of Copa America before being knocked out on penalties by Colombia, made 24 LaLiga appearances last season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Having stepped up from Barcelona B due to an injury crisis in the first-team, Araujo proved his worth by scoring and providing two assists.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Araujo defensive contribution could be huge for Koeman this season - having previously gone 13 successive games without being dribbled past. <br>
</p>
<p>
Sergino Dest is another player who has caught the attention of football fans around the world. His performances last year have also seen Europe's elite try to prise him away from Barcelona. <br>
</p>
<p>
The right-back - who suffered from a couple of injuries last season - made his debut for Barcelona in the 2020-2021 campaign and received offers from Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund this summer.  <br>
</p>
<p>
However, Dest is solely focused on succeeding at Barcelona and is eager to take every single opportunity he is granted at the club.    <br>
</p>
<p>
Dest's ability to play in tight spaces and choose when to pass or dribble makes him a valuable asset at the back. He will, however, need time to develop into a world-class player.    <br>
</p>
<p>
Yusuf Demir is another player who has been credited with 'turning into' Messi and carrying Barcelona during the club's 3-0 win against Stuttgart. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 18-year-old - who was signed on a season-long from Rapid Wien this summer - played the full 90 minutes in the Mercedes Benz Arena and scored his first goal for the club. <br>
</p>
<p>
He found the net from close-range after impressive build-up play from Memphis Depay and Antoine Griezmann.<br>
</p>
<p>
As a result, he caught the attention of the Barcelona boss and could feature regularly this season.  <br>
</p>
<p>
However, all of the youngsters mentioned in Mundo Deportivo will have to continue to work hard to replicate the form of Messi and create such a profound lasting legacy. <br>

<h2>
Man United legend Denis Law, 81, announces he has dementia and laments he cannot sign autographs any more, with 'The King of United' the sixth member of their 1968 European Cup squad to be diagnosed with the brain disease</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/12/46858317-0-image-a-27_1629370963866.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Manchester United legend Denis Law has revealed he has dementia.<br>
</p>
<p>
Law, 81, issued a statement on Thursday announcing that he has a combination of Alzheimer's and vascular dementia, and said the 'road ahead will be hard, demanding, painful and ever changing'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The man known simply as The King at United is one of the club's Holy Trinity alongside Sir Bobby Charlton and George Best who are immortalised by a statue outside Old Trafford.<br>
</p>
<p>
Law becomes the sixth member of the United squad that won the European Cup in 1968 to be diagnosed with the degenerative condition.<br>
</p>
<p>
In November, Charlton's family confirmed that he has dementia, days after fellow sufferer Nobby Stiles had passed away, and Tony Dunne, Bill Foulkes and David Herd were also diagnosed before their deaths. Law and Herd played in the '68 European campaign but missed the final through injury.<br>
</p>
<p>
The news that Law has now joined the growing list of United players from that golden era with dementia will add to the calls for more research into the links between the disease and heading a football.<br>
</p>
<p>
Law revealed in an interview with The Times back in December that he even avoided heading the ball in training while at Huddersfield Town due to concerns he had over his health.<br>
</p>
<p>
The former striker revealed he was worried about the impact of heading leather footballs, comparing them to 'medicine balls', and would only head them during matches.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We seemed to do it all the time in training, which was annoying because I was a puny wee thing, still developing physically, and preferred the ball at my feet.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We'd laugh about it but oh my God, ouch, when they got soggy those things were so heavy they were like medicine balls rather than footballs.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The lads used to take the mickey out of me because I started avoiding headers in practices because I felt it was doing me no good. I'd only challenge for the ball in the air during games at Huddersfield and for the rest of my career, and George [Best] was the same.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Law spent a total of 11 years at Manchester United, scoring 237 goals in 404 appearances. He won the First Division title twice and the FA Cup as well as the European Cup after Sir Matt Busby's side famously beat Benfica at Wembley.<br>
</p>
<p>
Announcing the news, the Scot admitted that he finds his condition distressing at times and wanted to explain why he will no longer be able to sign autographs for fans.<br>
</p>
<p>
Neuropathologist, Dr Willie Stewart, has established former players are 3.5 times more likely to die of neurodegenerative diseases than the general public.<br>
</p>
<p>
Dr Stewart is one of the leading experts on the link between football and dementia having studied the medical records of 7,676 men who played professionally between 1900 and 1976.<br>
</p>
<p>
In addition, the scientist also conducted tests on the brain tissue of the celebrated West Bromwich Albion centre forward, Jeff Astle, in 2014, concluding the striker suffered chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a condition traditionally associated with boxers. <br>
</p>
<p>
The University of Glasgow academic told the MPs earlier this year that while it will be difficult to demonstrate a direct causal link between heading a football and suffering dementia forty years later, he said, 'on a balance of probabilities, I think we are there'.<br>
</p>
<p>
MPs on the Digital, Culture Media and Sport select committee has been investigating the link between sport and brain disease.<br>
</p>
<p>
It has heard from experts and campaigners, including Dawn Astle, the daughter of West Bromwich Albion forward, Jeff.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jeff Astle died Astle aged 59 in 2002 from a degenerative brain disease due to heading the ball and Dawn has been an indefatigable campaigner.<br>
</p>
<p>
His daughter told MPs she had taken up the campaign over football and dementia after her father had been badly let down.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Football doesn't want to think that football can be a killer. But I know it can be, because it's on my dad's death certificate,' she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I want to make sure players affected are looked after properly,' she added. 'And I want to make sure the game is safe for players now and in the future.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I am at the point where I feel I want to be open about my condition,' he said. 'I have been diagnosed with 'mixed dementia', which is more than one type of dementia, in my case this being Alzheimer's and Vascular dementia. This has been an extremely difficult year for everyone and the long periods of isolation have certainly not helped.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It is an incredibly challenging and problematic disease and I have witnessed many friends go through this. You hope that it won't happen to you, even make jokes about it whilst ignoring the early signs because you don't want it to be true. You get angry, frustrated, confused and then worried, worried for your family, as they will be the ones dealing with it.<br>
</p>
<p>
'However, the time has come to tackle this head on, excuse the pun. I recognise how my brain is deteriorating and how my memory evades me when I don't want it to and how this causes me distress in situations that are beyond my control. I do understand what is happening and that is why I want to address my situation now whilst I am able, because I know there will be days when I don't understand and I hate the thought of that right now.<br>
</p>
<p>
'In the height of the pandemic I said I hoped that if one positive was to come out of it, it would be that it would make people kinder to each other, so that's what I am hoping for now. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I don't want people to be saddened if I forget places, people or dates because you need to remember I enjoyed all those memories and I am lucky to have experienced what I have in my life … a loving and supportive family, a great career doing what I loved and getting paid to do it and lifelong friends.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I have good days and bad days and aim to take each day as it comes adjusting my lifestyle accordingly. I hung up my football boots a long time ago and now it's time to put my signing days behind me too, so apologies to anyone who has sent me anything but I am just not able.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I am trying to be positive and determined to continue watching my club, Manchester United at Old Trafford, hopefully this will be a season of success and I am excited by the new signings that Ole and the club have made.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Also where possible I would like to continue my involvement with the 'Denis Law Legacy Trust', the work the staff and volunteers do in the community is amazing and it makes a real difference.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I know the road ahead will be hard, demanding, painful and ever changing and so ask for understanding and patience as this will not be an easy journey especially for the people who love you the most.<br>
</p>
<p>
'My daughter, Di, is completing The Thames Bridges Trek on September 11 to raise money for the Alzheimer's Society so if you can please donate at www.justgiving.com/thelawman.<br>
</p>
<p>
'As a family, we have been offered support by Alzheimer's Society and have chosen to fundraise for the charity to help support its crucial work. Alzheimer's Society's services have never been in more need, used over 5.5million times since March 2020, and are a lifeline to thousands of families who are also facing a dementia diagnosis.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The charity is also doing amazing work with the sports industry, with its Sport United Against Dementia campaign, which I fully support. This really could make the biggest difference to former players, players, and fans alike. Thank you.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The Alzheimer's Society responded to Law's announcement by expressing hope that it will help other sufferers to reach out for help.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chief executive Kate Lee said: 'We have offered support to Denis Law and the whole family. We are incredibly thankful to the family for choosing to raise vital funds for us and hope Denis's bravery in coming forward will encourage many others to seek the help they need, for which we are hugely grateful.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We've seen too many sporting heroes impacted by the condition, which is why our Sport United Against Dementia campaign is needed now more than ever.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's never been more important to fund crucial research and our vital support services and ensure that right now, past and present players, as well as fans, know our services are here and can get the dedicated dementia support they deserve.'<br>
</p>
<p>
United also issued a statement offering Law and his family best wishes and support.<br>
</p>
<p>
It read: ‘Denis Law will always be one of this club’s greatest legends and everybody at Manchester United sends our love and best wishes to him and his family.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘We know our fans around the world will also rally behind him. We applaud Denis’s brave words and will continue to offer whatever support we can as he adapts to this challenging condition.’<br>
</p>
<p>
The DCMS backed several demands put to football's governing bodies by Sportsmail in our seven-point charter last November:<br>
</p>
<p>
1 - Increased funding from the FA and PFA for independent research into dementia and its links to football.<br>
</p>
<p>
2 - The PFA to provide respite for families and carers of former professional footballers living with dementia.<br>
</p>
<p>
3 - The PFA to appoint a dedicated 'dementia team' and work with, promote and financially assist Alzheimer's Society's Sport United Against Dementia campaign and Dementia Connect support line.<br>
</p>
<p>
4 - The PFA to help fund regular social events for people living with dementia and their carers.<br>
</p>
<p>
5 - Dementia to be formally recognised as an industrial disease.<br>
</p>
<p>
6 - Football's lawmakers, IFAB, to ratify temporary concussion replacements.<br>
</p>
<p>
7 - Clubs to limit heading at all levels. Maximum of 20 headers per session in training. Minimum 48 hours between sessions.<br>

<h2>
Martin Odegaard 'unlikely to be available for Arsenal's Premier League derby with Chelsea on Sunday due to visa issues' but Aaron Ramsdale 'is set to be in the squad' for weekend Emirates Stadium clash</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/13/46860105-0-image-m-36_1629376092003.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Martin Odegaard is unlikely to be available for Arsenal's Premier League clash with Chelsea on Sunday due to visa issues but Aaron Ramsdale should be available, according to reports.<br>
</p>
<p>
As Sportsmail revealed this week, Odegaard had his Gunners medical on Wednesday ahead of his £30million transfer from Real Madrid, which comes a few months after his six-month loan spell at the Emirates Stadium ended.<br>
</p>
<p>
Odegaard is set to be followed into north London by Sheffield United goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, who is set to arrive for an initial £24m, but the deal could rise to £30m. <br>
</p>
<p>
But according to football.london, a delay on Odegaard's approved visa means the Norwegian is struggling to gain registration in time to face European champions Chelsea at the Emirates on Sunday.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 22-year-old needs to be registered by midday on Friday in order to be able to play this weekend, as the Gunners try to avoid back-to-back defeats at the start of this Premier League season.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The report adds that Ramsdale is also completing his medical on Thursday but should have no issues to make the matchday squad for the visit of the Blues. <br>
</p>
<p>
The two transfers should be completed within the next 48 hours and will be Arteta's fourth and fifth summer signings after Ben White, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Nuno Tavares moved to north London.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Head coach Mikel Arteta had always earmarked the return of Odegaard as a priority signing after a number of impressive displays during his spell at the club last season.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The Norwegian played 20 times for the Gunners during the second half of last season, scoring once and registering two assists for Arteta's men, who finished the Premier League season in eighth spot and reached the Europa League semi-finals.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ramsdale, meanwhile, suffered back-to-back relegations from the Premier League with Bournemouth and then United, but was part of Gareth Southgate's final 26-man England squad for Euro 2020 as a back-up to Jordan Pickford. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 23-year-old will compete with Bernd Leno for a starting spot at the Emirates Stadium this season, with the German goalkeeper at fault for one of Brentford's two goals in Arsenal's opening day defeat. <br>
</p>
<p>
Odegaard, meanwhile, has healthy midfield competition in Bukayo Saka and Emile Smith Rowe, though the Gunners sold attacking midfielder Joe Willock to Newcastle for £25m. <br>

<h2>
Pedro signs two-year deal with Lazio from Roma on the first transfer between the two Roman rival in 40 years after falling out of favour under Jose Mourinho</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/12/46859459-0-image-a-1_1629373529235.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Pedro has completed his Roma exit with a shock move to arch-rivals Lazio after being exiled by Jose Mourinho. <br>
</p>
<p>
The forward makes the rare switch after Roma released him for free, according to Gazzetta. <br>
</p>
<p>
His contract with the Giallorossi wasn't set to expire until 2023 but the 34-year-old has agreed a two-year deal worth €2m (£1.7m) a year with Lazio.<br>
</p>
<p>
The exchange is one of convenience for both clubs, in particular for Roma who will save considerably in the wake of Pedro's exit.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Roma are in need of balancing their books after becoming burgeoned with debt and the former Chelsea striker would have cost the Giallorossi another £6.8million over the next two seasons. <br>
</p>
<p>
Pedro also waived his month's wages owed by Roma for August. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Giallorossi were unwilling to sell or loan Pedro abroad as they would lose tax breaks with the cost potentially amounting to €3.5m (almost £3m). <br>
</p>
<p>
The low-cost transfer also works in Lazio's favour as the Biancocelesti haven't been able to register new players unless President Claudio Lotito pumps £8.5m into the club. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Spaniard only joined Roma last summer after his Chelsea contract expired but has been deemed surplus to requirements since Mourinho's arrival at the Stadio Olimpico.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pedro had been a regular starter under Paulo Fonseca, making 40 appearances in all competitions, registering six goals and seven assists. <br>
</p>
<p>
But the forward was shunned under Mourinho, who was responsible for bringing Pedro to Stamford Bridge in 2015, and didn't even feature in Roma's pre-season training. <br>
</p>
<p>
From one former Chelsea manager to another, Pedro will reunite with Maurizio Sarri at Lazio. <br>
</p>
<p>
Sarri could look to play his latest signing in their Serie A opener against Empoli on Saturday.<br>
</p>
<p>
The last exchange over the river Tiber was in 1981 when Carlo Perrone completed the reverse of Pedro's move, switching Lazio for Roma.   <br>
</p>
<p>
In more recent times, Angelo Peruzzi, Sinisa Mihajlovic and Diego Fuser have all worn both shirts but with intervals at other clubs between the two stints. <br>

Harvey Barnes reveals it was a 'no brainer' to sign a new four-year deal at Leicester with winger having become a star man under Brendan Rodgers</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/11/46857289-0-image-a-16_1629368589677.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Harvey Barnes has signed a new four-year deal with boyhood club Leicester. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 23-year-old attacker enjoyed a stellar 2020-21 campaign, scoring 13 times in all competitions and making his England debut before a knee injury cut short his season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Barnes has established himself as a regular under Brendan Rodgers during the last two terms and is excited for what is to come at the King Power Stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
"I've been here for so many years now, it feels like home," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
"For me, it was a no-brainer. Of course, I wanted to extend my stay here.<br>
</p>
<p>
"It's been something that's been going on in the background and to sign now is great. It's right at the start of a new season as well, which I know everyone is excited about."<br>
</p>
<p>
While Barnes missed Leicester's FA Cup final win in May, he had scored in the third-round win over Stoke and also shone in their Community Shield success over Manchester City at the start of August.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 23-year-old made his Foxes debut midway through the 2016-17 campaign, but spent the majority of the next few years on loan at MK Dons, Barnsley and then West Brom.<br>
</p>
<p>
It was at the Hawthorns where his goalscoring capabilities come to the fore and it convinced the Leicester hierarchy to give the wide-man a five-year deal in the summer of 2019.<br>

Brighton in talks to complete a club record £25m deal for Benfica striker Darwin Nunez as Graham Potter looks to strengthen his attacking options before the end of the transfer window</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/15/46863191-0-image-m-32_1629381653390.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Brighton are in talks with Benfica over a £25million swoop for striker Darwin Nunez.<br>
</p>
<p>
Seagulls officials are locked in discussions with their Portuguese counterparts with a view to concluding a deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
If Brighton can come to an agreement for Nunez, the Uruguay international will become the club's record signing. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 22-year-old scored 14 goals for Benfica last season and has notched twice for his national team in four appearances. <br>
</p>
<p>
The youngster also managed an impressive 12 assists in all competitions for the Portuguese club. <br>
</p>
<p>
Nunez began his career with Urguayan side Penarol before joining second-tier Spanish club Almeria in 2019.<br>
</p>
<p>
The striker's 16 goals in his first season in Spain convinced Benfica to pay a club record fee of £21.8m last summer. Almeria are also thought have a 20 per cent sell-on clause.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Seagulls have been looking to sign a striker in this window after struggling in front of goal last season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Only five teams scored fewer goals than Graham Potter's side last term, with Neal Maupay finishing the campaign as top scorer with eight.<br>

<h2>
'We were astounded when we heard what United paid Sanchez and his agent': Arsenal's ex-transfer chief opens up on their infamous Mkhitaryan swap deal... and how Raiola 'leveraged the whole deal'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/09/46855099-0-image-a-74_1629363163224.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Arsenal's former transfer chief Dick Law says he was left 'astounded' when he heard how much Manchester United were paying Alexis Sanchez and his agent after the Gunners agreed to a swap deal for Henrikh Mkhitaryan in 2018.<br>
</p>
<p>
With Sanchez in the final year of his Arsenal contract during the 2017-18 campaign, the Gunners were desperate to get something for the Chilean in the winter transfer window after turning down a £60million bid from Manchester City before the start of the season.<br>
</p>
<p>
United and Arsenal were able to agree to a rare player-swap deal without seeing a single penny exchanged, which saw long-time Gunners target Mkhitaryan head in the opposite direction. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, the finances involved to bring Sanchez to United left Law stunned, while revealing in an interview with The Athletic how Sanchez's agent Mino Raiola 'leveraged the whole transaction'.<br>
</p>
<p>
When explaining how difficult player swap deals are to sanction, Law, who was Arsenal's transfer negotiator between 2009 and 2018, said: 'I think, first of all, it comes down to valuation of players; every owner thinks their pony is the prettiest one at the fair.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Sanchez was willing to go to United and Mkhitaryan wanted to go to Arsenal, and that's why it worked. <br>
</p>
<p>
'The third issue would have been the player negotiations and agents' commissions. We were astounded when we heard what United paid the player and paid the agent.' <br>
</p>
<p>
According to German magazine Der Spiegel, Sanchez ended up earning a whopping £391,000 a week when at United, picking up a £6.7m signing on fee, while Mhkitaryan earned £144,000 a week at the Emirates and had a £8.5m loyalty bonus on top of that – and that's even before Raiola was paid a penny for his playing his part in the move.<br>
</p>
<p>
Law claims that he was left to deal with Raiola in 'trying to sort out exactly where Mkhitaryan stood' while the clubs negotiated the transfer of the two players.<br>
</p>
<p>
With Sanchez desperate to leave the Emirates, Law insists it was clear that 'anywhere but Arsenal' was fine for the player which saw Raiola take full advantage, with the deal being driven by United's desire to acquire Sanchez.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The Sanchez-Mkhitaryan deal came down to the worst possible denominator, and that was Mino Raiola,' Law adds. 'And let me say this, I like Mino, I can work with Mino all day and all night. Mino is a top professional. But Mino understands leverage.<br>
</p>
<p>
'And Man United, for whatever reason, left Mino as the last piece of the puzzle. You can imagine the leverage Mino had knowing that Sanchez was the critical element of the deal, and I think that's how he leveraged the whole transaction.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Sanchez's move to Old Trafford ended up being a complete disaster, which saw him make just 45 appearances and scored five goals before he was loaned out to Inter Milan in 2019, with the move being made permanent a year later.<br>
</p>
<p>
For Mkhitaryan, the Armenian peaked on his Gunners debut with a hat-trick of assists against Everton but faded during his time in north London.<br>
</p>
<p>
Like Sanchez, Mkhitaryan was loaned out in 2019, with Roma taking him on board before signing him permanently a year later. <br>

<h2>
Liverpool 'begin talks to award Mohamed Salah with new two-year extension to make him the highest-paid player in the club's HISTORY eclipsing Virgil van Dijk's new £220,000-a-week contract'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/08/46853029-0-image-a-12_1629358205063.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Liverpool have begun negotiations to make Mohamed Salah the highest-paid player in the club's history with a new four-year deal, according to reports. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Egyptian winger - widely regarded as one of the most important players in Jurgen Klopp's squad - is currently on a £200,000-a-week contract that runs until the summer of 2023.<br>
</p>
<p>
Reds sporting director Michael Edwards is currently on a contract extension spree after renewing deals for the likes of Virgil van Dijk, Alisson Becker and Trent Alexander-Arnold this summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
And according to The Athletic, Liverpool want to extend Salah's contract by a further two years until 2025 in a record-breaking deal for the Merseyside club. <br>
</p>
<p>
The reported deal means Salah would hold that contract until he is 33 years of age and would extend his Anfield career to eight years. Dutch defender Virgil van Dijk is currently the Reds best earner on a reported £220,000-a-week deal. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 29-year-old has scored 126 goals and registered 49 assists in 204 matches since making the switch to Liverpool from Roma in the summer of 2017. <br>
</p>
<p>
Salah made an immediate impact at Liverpool, scoring 44 goals in all competitions in his debut season, while he ended last year as the Premier League Golden Boot runner-up with 22 strikes, one behind winner Harry Kane. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Reds winger has begun the current campaign in similar goalscoring form, finding the net in Liverpool's opening Premier League match of the season away at Norwich, whilst also setting up two other goals in the 3-0 win. <br>
</p>
<p>
Salah has long been linked with a move away from Liverpool and refused to rule out a move to Barcelona or Real Madrid later in his career in December last year. <br>
</p>
<p>
His former Egypt team-mate Mohamed Aboutrika revealed last winter that he called Salah at the time and the Liverpool star revealed he was unhappy at the club. <br>
</p>
<p>
But a contract renewal would be a major boost to Liverpool as they would be able to keep hold of their main man as he enters the final peak years of his career, and his renewal would be the latest in a long line of extensions signed by Reds first-team stars. <br>
</p>
<p>
Trent Alexander-Arnold was the first to pen a new deal by signing a four-year extension in late July, and the England right-back's statement of commitment was swiftly followed by a contract for Brazilian midfielder Fabinho days later. <br>

Goalkeeper Alisson also penned a new deal in the first week of July while Van Dijk also signed on the dotted line last week. <br>

Referee charity blasts 'DISGRACEFUL' Neil Warnock after Middlesbrough boss raged at officials following QPR defeat... and claim 'his pantomime show encourages ref abuse' </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/09/46855205-0-image-a-57_1629363510429.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
A referee charity has slammed 'disgraceful' Neil Warnock after the Middlesbrough boss raged at officials following their 3-2 defeat by QPR on Wednesday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Uche Ikpeazu had given Boro the lead in the seventh minute before a Jonny Howson own goal and a striker from Lyndon Dykes put QPR 2-1 ahead early in the second half. <br>
</p>
<p>
Matt Crooks then equalised for Warnock's men in the 72nd minute but Chris Willock netted a winner for the away side four minutes later. The Boro boss was left unhappy with a number of decisions from the officials and made his feelings clear at full-time.<br>
</p>
<p>
Warnock marched onto the pitch and confronted referee Steve Martin and his assistants, with pictures showing the manager visibly shouting and waving his arms in the air.<br>
</p>
<p>
He claimed QPR forward Charlie Austin headbutted Boro's Grant Hall and was also unhappy with a number of offside decisions. <br>
</p>
<p>
While Warnock felt he and his team had been hard done by, referee charity Ref Support UK took to Twitter to condemn his treatment of the officials, labelling the manager as an 'embarrassment to football'. <br>
</p>
<p>
They tweeted: 'On the day @itvnews run a 2 day special report on ref abuse, this happens.<br>
</p>
<p>
'This man is an embarrassment to football. Every season his pantomime show encourages ref abuse.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Clubs that employ him like, @Boro need to take a hard long look at themselves. Disgraceful. @EnglandFootball.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Warnock outlined his grievances during in his post-match interview with Radio Tees.   <br>
</p>
<p>
'We have not been helped [by the officials],' he told BBC Radio Tees.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Isaiah's [Jones] tackle was a super tackle but the referee saw it differently.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The linesman has given two offsides which are never offside in a million years and you expect better from that officials and I just told them that. I'll have to write about it and I'll get a report saying "yeah, you were right..."<br>
</p>
<p>
'And then Charlie Austin headbutts Grant Hall and nothing gets done about it. I find it amazing they only see certain things.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Warnock joined Alan Brazil on talkSPORT on Thursday morning and had more criticism for the referee, but said <br>
</p>
<p>
'You're trying to get me fired!' he told Brazil after being asked whether the referee had spoken to him.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The FA guy will be listening, taping everything and they always quote "Neil Warnock said this on talkSPORT, Alan Brazil." Then they fine me and you never pay it, Alan!<br>
</p>
<p>
'All I said to him was "don't go home early because I want to see you in 30 minutes", that's all I said to him.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We had two chances and the linesman flagged offside twice and both times they were onside. What do you say? That's their living, they should be better than that - that's my disappointment.'  <br>
</p>
<p>
While Boro were unhappy with the officiating, their opening goal came when Martin awarded the home side a penalty after Dykes pulled Dael Fry's shirt in the area.<br>
</p>
<p>
Martin also sent off QPR's Moses Odubajo in the second half after the defender was given a second yellow card for shoving Isaiah Jones.<br>

<h2>
Robert Lewandowski 'wants a new challenge AWAY from Bayern Munich and is frustrated by the club's reluctance to sell him' with the Bundesliga giants valuing their star man at £100m</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/08/46853325-0-image-a-37_1629358847416.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Robert Lewandowski reportedly wants to leave Bayern Munich for a new challenge but could be priced out of a move because the Bundesliga side value him at £100million.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lewandowski, who turns 33 on Saturday, has won 18 trophies since joining Bayern in 2014 and has scored 297 goals in 331 games. <br>
</p>
<p>
But according to Sky Sports News, the Poland international wants to secure a move to another top European side before reaching the age of 35.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lewandowski is said to be happy at Bayern and will not do anything to jeopardise his relationship with the club but is frustrated by their reluctance to sell.<br>
</p>
<p>
The forward is under contract until 2023 but Bayern have not proposed an extension. Lewandowski will be approaching the age of 35 if he stays with the Bundesliga side until the end of his current deal. <br>
</p>
<p>
His age may make it harder to join another top European club but the Polish star is renowned for keeping himself in the best physical condition.<br>
</p>
<p>
Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola previously described Lewandowski as the most professional person he had ever met.<br>
</p>
<p>
The prolific striker netted 56 times for club and country last season and his 41 goals in the Bundesliga broke the scoring record which had been held by Gerd Muller since the 1971-1972 campaign.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lewandowski fuelled speculation that he could leave Bayern back in May after admitting he is curious about experiencing a different culture and learning a new language.<br>
</p>
<p>
He told French TV channel Canal+: 'I remain open-minded. I feel very good at Bayern, the city is superb, it's a great club.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I am always curious to learn a new language, a new culture. But whether it will be in football or after my career, even I don't know.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea and Barcelona have previously been linked with the forward but a move to either club would now appear unlikely. <br>
</p>
<p>
Barca are in the midst of a financial crisis while Chelsea have just spent £98m on Romeu Lukaku. <br>

<h2>
Manchester United 'offer to make Paul Pogba their best-paid player on a huge £400,000-per-week deal' ahead of David de Gea... but French star is STILL not ready to sign, with PSG ready to swoop for free transfer next summer </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/08/46853389-0-image-a-11_1629358924091.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Manchester United are set to make Paul Pogba the highest-paid player at the club with a new five-year contract worth £400,000 per week, according to The Athletic.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pogba has just one year remaining on his current £290,000-a-week deal and United are 'desperate' to extend his stay at Old Trafford before the transfer window closes.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, the French midfielder is yet to accept United's latest offer - which will see him earn more than David de Gea who is earning £375,000 per week.<br>
</p>
<p>
David De Gea - £375k per week <br>
</p>
<p>
Raphael Varane - £340k per week  <br>
</p>
<p>
Jadon Sancho - £300k per week <br>
</p>
<p>
Paul Pogba - £290k per week<br>
</p>
<p>
Harry Maguire - £250k per week <br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Pogba's new contract will also see him surpass the wages of United's summer signings Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho - who agreed to a long-term contract worth around £340,000 and £300,000-a-week respectively. <br>
</p>
<p>
United chiefs are eager for Pogba to sign the new deal - which would run for a minimum of four years, with the option of extending until 2025.<br>
</p>
<p>
They believe the significant increase on his £290,000-a-week wages will help protect the player's market value and prevent them from losing him for free next summer after an £89million outlay to sign him in 2016.  <br>
</p>
<p>
However, as previously reported by Sportsmail, Pogba will take his time to assess his options as a free transfer to Paris Saint-Germain next season remains a possibility. <br>
</p>
<p>
PSG had been linked with a move for Pogba this summer, but Lionel Messi's shock switch to the Ligue 1 side stopped any deal from happening as the club prioritised the Argentine superstar instead. <br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, as previously reported by Sportsmail, PSG have since offered Pogba a mammoth £510,000-a-week salary if he joins them on a free next summer. <br>
</p>
<p>
Pogba has also been linked with moves to Real Madrid and Barcelona this summer but their well-publicised financial issues have put the midfielder off a move until he's out of contract – allowing him to move for no transfer fee.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, it is unlikely that Pogba will put pen to paper with Manchester United before the transfer window closes at 11pm on August 31 as he weighs up his options. <br>
</p>
<p>
Should United fail to secure his signature, it would be the second time Pogba has walked away from Old Trafford, having joined Juventus in 2012 at the expiry of his contract. <br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Pogba got the new 2021-22 campaign off to the flying start on Saturday after he played a pivotal role in United's 5-1 triumph win over arch rivals Leeds at Old Trafford.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Bruno Fernandes walked away with the match ball and Mason Greenwood caught the fans attention, but it was Pogba who was the star of the show.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The Frenchman recorded four assists during United's victory - causing manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to sing the midfielder's praises after the game.  <br>
</p>
<p>
'Impressive,' Solskjaer said of Pogba's vision. 'Paul's always got that vision, he's got that quality. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I know that the headlines will probably be about Bruno or Paul but this is a team effort and the space Mason creates for Bruno to open up the channels, what everyone does ahead of the goals has been worked on this week.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But, Paul, I'm very impressed with his fitness levels as well. He's not been with us for too long and he looks fit, ready to go, enjoying his football.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I love seeing Paul and all these boys smiling when they're playing football.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Pogba reportedly prepared for the 2021-2022 season by completing several conditioning sessions with coaches from the NBA's Miami Heat while on holiday in the US. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Frenchman's involvement in the basketball set-up has come under fire previously - given he was seen shooting hoops with Jimmy Butler in November 2019 while out injured with an ankle injury. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, Solskjaer will have zero complaints this time round as the 28-year-old is firing for Manchester United.  <br>

<h2>
Get Saka back NOW, remove the cloud hanging over Aubameyang and Lacazette and drop Pablo Mari: Odegaard and Ramsdale may be on the way, but Arteta still has plenty to do to ensure Arsenal's AWFUL start to the season doesn't continue</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/07/46851839-0-image-a-6_1629355980229.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Arsenal's Premier League campaign got off to a disastrous start with a 2-0 defeat away to Brentford and Mikel Arteta must now act quickly with daunting tasks against Chelsea and Manchester City on the horizon.<br>
</p>
<p>
Even when it is taken into account that they were missing a host of key players, the Gunners' performance against Brentford was woeful as they succumbed to the newly-promoted side.<br>
</p>
<p>
Martin Odegaard and Aaron Ramsdale's imminent arrivals from Real Madrid and Sheffield United respectively address some of the problem areas but there are still many other issues that need to be addressed.<br>
</p>
<p>
Here's a look at what Arsenal need to sort in an attempt to ensure they don't end up with zero points out of a possible nine from their first three games.<br>
</p>
<p>
More tactical freedom<br>
</p>
<p>
It is clear that Arsenal need greater variety in their game and there is an overreliance on Emile Smith Rowe and Kieran Tierney to create chances, with the latter frequently pushing forward from left-back and delivering crosses.<br>
</p>
<p>
Under Arteta Arsenal's play seems too precise, with players seemingly not permitted to take risks and often electing for the safe pass as opposed to driving forward.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arteta needs to give Nicolas Pepe, for instance, more licence to come infield on some occasions and have an impact on the game.<br>
</p>
<p>
Gabriel Martinelli seemed to be under specific instructions as he drifted inside to provide space for Tierney to push forward but this often resulted in the Brazilian becoming a peripheral figure himself. Arsenal weren't making the most of their best assets. <br>
</p>
<p>
Another such asset is now set to join the attacking set-up in Odegaard, who combined well with Smith Rowe in the second half of last season, but it remains to be seen how Arteta can tactically get the separate parts to work. <br>
</p>
<p>
Drop Pablo Mari<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal are currently without Gabriel Magalhaes due to injury, with Pablo Mari having been given a start against Brentford.<br>
</p>
<p>
As has been the case on several other occasions, Mari struggled, with the centre-back not strong enough physically, his pace in recovery lacking and his positional sense also questionable.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arteta's options in terms of replacing Mari are somewhat restricted at present, but he can bring in Rob Holding, who is capable of playing on the left side of the centre-back pairing.<br>
</p>
<p>
Holding himself isn't the most reliable player but he should offer more authority than Mari, who will end up costing Arsenal more points if he is persisted with.<br>
</p>
<p>
Against the creative players that Chelsea and City possess, starting Mari would be a huge risk. <br>
</p>
<p>
Holding may also prove to be a better central defensive partner for new £50million signing Ben White, who found matters difficult against Brentford.<br>
</p>
<p>
Calum Chambers is another centre-back option and impressed there under Arteta prior to his serious knee injury in December 2019, but he was another member of the faltering backline at Brentford.<br>
</p>
<p>
Start Bukayo Saka <br>
</p>
<p>
Saka missed the majority of pre-season after representing England at Euro 2020 but was brought on for the final half an hour against Brentford.<br>
</p>
<p>
While he wasn't at his sharpest, the winger still helped to improve Arsenal's attacking play, posing more questions to the hosts' defence and threatening to get in behind them at any given opportunity. <br>
</p>
<p>
With another week of training under his belt, Saka should be ready to start at home to Chelsea on Sunday, and Arsenal will certainly need him. <br>
</p>
<p>
Last season Saka, singlehandedly at times, dragged his team out of difficult situations, and seven goals and 10 assists demonstrated the extent to which his creativity proved difficult for defenders to deal with. <br>
</p>
<p>
Saka is also capable of combining effectively with fellow youngster Smith Rowe, with the pair having both impressed in the corresponding fixture against Chelsea last season, which Arsenal won 3-1. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Gunners no doubt have question marks on who should feature more regularly in the forward positions, but Saka is not part of those doubts and should now be thrust back into to aid his struggling side. <br>
</p>
<p>
Provide clarity on Aubameyang and Lacazette<br>
</p>
<p>
Even though their consistency can fluctuate and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been a shadow of his usual self for some time, it was clear that Arsenal missed both the Gabon striker and Alexandre Lacazette against Brentford.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arteta stated that both players were missing through illness but there have been suggestions that the problem could be somewhat deeper.<br>
</p>
<p>
Gary Neville, for instance, said on his Sky Sports podcast: 'You can see tonight in his interview after the game... I don't know if there is something in the Aubameyang and Lacazette in the pre-match, to be fair.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I thought there was a little bit of something there where he talked about they are ill earlier on today, that's all I can say. It was a bit short.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I never quite know if there's some problems deeper, whether he likes his players and I really worry when a manager doesn't like some of the dressing room.'<br>
</p>
<p>
There have been tentative links to Barcelona being interested in the strikers but Arsenal need to address this situation.<br>
</p>
<p>
With all the other problems they have, Arsenal don't need this cloud hanging over them as well. <br>
</p>
<p>
If Aubameyang and Lacazette are unavailable against Chelsea, Arteta needs to provide a detailed explanation why and an indication of when they will be back. Otherwise, the speculation and uncertainty will only increase.     <br>
</p>
<p>
Provide Bernd Leno with competition<br>
</p>
<p>
This appears to be on the verge of completion with Aaron Ramsdale set to join, but the Brentford game showed why Arsenal needed to bring in a goalkeeper who can challenge or even replace Bernd Leno.<br>
</p>
<p>
The German is capable of making fantastic saves at times but makes positional errors - as he did by being beaten by Sergi Canos' opener - and struggles with playing the ball out from the back. <br>
</p>
<p>
His passing apparently saw him cop an X-rated earful from Mari and the Germany international's struggles with the ball at his feet has once again led Gunners fans back to discussing Emi Martinez, who started many Arsenal attacks during his last few months at the club. <br>
</p>
<p>
Alex Runarsson wasn't in the squad against Brentford and has fallen out of favour after an error-strewn start to life as a Gunner, so 19-year-old Karl Hein was on the bench.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sheffield United now appear to have dropped their £40m asking price for Ramsdale, who is now set to link up with the Gunners after the two clubs agreed a £24m fee plus add-ons.<br>
</p>
<p>
Reports suggest they have targeted the England international for his ability with his feet, but whether he will be able to eventually make the step up to become Arsenal No 1 remains to be seen. <br>
</p>
<p>
Overall, there is much work for Arteta to do in a short space of time but he does have resources to use in an attempt to improve matters, and starting Saka in particular would give Arsenal a huge boost. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, if the defeat to Brentford is followed by two further losses it will inevitably cause further questions to be asked regarding Arteta's capability for the job.  <br>

<h2>
Newcastle midfielder Joe Willock considered quitting social media after receiving racist abuse on a 'daily basis' and says players are forced to ignore messages because platforms have not 'put up enough of a fight'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/07/46850303-0-image-m-17_1629353573944.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Newcastle midfielder Joe Willock says he receives racist abuse on a 'daily basis' and admitted he has considered quitting social media. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 21-year-old, who sealed a £22million move to the Magpies from Arsenal last week, said he continues to uses the platforms to maintain his connection with the 'wonderful fans' who support him.<br>
</p>
<p>
But speaking to BBC Radio Newcastle, Willock said the abuse 'hurts a lot' and called on social media companies to do more to tackle the problem.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Every day I get messages,' he said. 'Messages saying about my colour or different things that are disgusting, really.<br>
</p>
<p>
'There's not much you can do - you just have to try and ignore it. I don't think Instagram, Facebook and Twitter have put up enough of a fight for us to do anything else.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I feel like the only thing you can do in this day and age is just ignore it and try to put it at the back of your head.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It comes up on your phone and they have a way of direct messaging you on to your phone these disgusting things and it sort of hurts. It hurts a lot - even speaking about it.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Football clubs, players and other sporting figures and bodies in England undertook a four-day boycott of social media in April in a show of solidarity against online abuse.  <br>
</p>
<p>
While Willock admitted he had considered coming off social media completely, the midfielder insisted using the platforms brings him closer to supporters. <br>
</p>
<p>
He added: 'If you come off social media, you lose that connection with all the wonderful fans that are supporting me every day, want to see my everyday life and see what I do and have that connection with me over the platform that they wouldn't have in real life.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Several players have spoken out on the online abuse they have receieved. <br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka urged Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to do more after he, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho were all racially abused after missing their penalties in England's Euro 2020 final defeat by Italy.<br>
</p>
<p>
'To the social media platforms Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, I don't want any child or adult to have to receive the hateful and hurtful messages that me, Marcus and Jadon have received this week,' he said last month.<br>
</p>
<p>
'There is no place for racism or hate of any kind in football or any area of society and to the majority of people coming together to call out the people sending these messages, by taking action and reporting these to the police and driving out the hate by being kind to one another, we will win.' <br>

<h2>
Gary Cahill set to complete free transfer to Bournemouth after leaving Crystal Palace earlier this summer, with Scott Parker hoping his former England team-mate can provide much-needed experience for promotion push </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/13/46860855-0-image-m-58_1629377847861.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Gary Cahill is poised to complete his move to Bournemouth following a medical today.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 35-year old is a free agent after leaving Crystal Palace and has opted to sign a one year contract with the Championship side where manager Scott Parker is targeting promotion.<br>
</p>
<p>
Parker believes Cahill's vast experience can prove invaluable to his young squad. The pair were England team-mates under Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson and faced off in the Premier League on several occasions. <br>
</p>
<p>
The centre-back has not played in the second tier since a loan spell with Sheffield United in 2008, but Cahill has lifted two Premier League titles, two FA Cups, two Europa League trophies and the 2012 Champions League with Chelsea since then. <br>
</p>
<p>
He amassed over 450 top-flight appearances for Aston Villa, Bolton, Chelsea and Palace before his exit from the latter earlier this summer. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Cherries are hoping to finalise a deal for Manchester City winger Morgan Rogers, as revealed by Sportsmail, before the weekend and have also expressed interest in Southampton striker Michael Obafemi.<br>
</p>
<p>
Rogers, 19, is scheduled to have a medical this evening once finer details of his move from City are finalised.<br>
</p>
<p>
England U18 international Rogers is joining on an initial loan with obligation for a permanent £9million transfer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Parker's Cherries have started the new Championship season strongly with two wins and a draw from their opening three league games, and currently sit fourth in the second tier table. <br>

<h2>
Romelu Lukaku insists former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte has made him a 'complete player' as he vows to become a Stamford Bridge hit at the second time of asking following his £98m move... and says he's 'intrigued' to play under Thomas Tuchel</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/21/46834519-0-image-a-13_1629318343018.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
If Romelu Lukaku is to be the player who helps Chelsea become a Premier League-winning team, he will have to show himself to be a more effective footballer than the last time he was playing in England with Manchester United.<br>
</p>
<p>
In Lukaku's mind, there is no doubt that he will. His two-year spell in Italy with Inter Milan not only restored some confidence, it also contained a technical breakthrough that some would argue had taken too long to arrive. Coincidentally the coach he credits is Antonio Conte, who brought Chelsea their last league title in 2017.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The Italian game is so different as it's so tactical and technical,' said Lukaku on Wednesday. <br>
</p>
<p>
'We always had a lot of possession. Most of the time I was back to goal and everything was going through me. I remember having a conversation with Conte about this.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He told me if I wasn't good at that, I wouldn't play. For me that was an eye-opener. Once I mastered that aspect then for me everything became easier.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The game would slow down and I could control it more and give more assists. That was really something I wanted to do and I wanted to experience that in another country, where I thought it would be beneficial for the rest of my career.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Now Lukaku, still only 28, has his opportunity and it will be interesting to see what happens. <br>
</p>
<p>
His first spell at Chelsea — which began when he was just 18 — is not memorable or informative. But his time at Everton proved to be both.<br>
</p>
<p>
At times back then Lukaku was almost unplayable, but largely when the ball was played in front of him or in the air. At Manchester United he was occasionally effective but rarely so when required to contribute the kind of link-up play he now claims to have honed and developed in Serie A.<br>
</p>
<p>
It stands to reason, then, that the challenge now is to bring this to Thomas Tuchel's team back in a league that Lukaku admits continues to present its own unique challenges. 'Watching the Premier League over the last few years, the players have got better, the teams have got better and I am ready for the challenge,' he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The Premier League has a bit of everything but the experiences in Italy made me more complete as a player.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Lukaku's strike rate of 64 goals in 98 games for Belgium and 47 in 72 Serie A appearances put him alongside almost any striker in world football. At Everton, between 2013 and 2017, he also struck at a Premier League rate of almost exactly one goal every two appearances.<br>
</p>
<p>
Anything like those standards would do for Chelsea this season. But his time at United — first under Jose Mourinho and then Ole Gunnar Solskjaer — remains fresh in the memory. At times, the Belgian looked lost and he admitted on Wednesday that it's this perception of him that will follow him back to England, at least in part.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The perception is something that you get to a point where you just don't fight against it,' he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Really that is something that I thought to myself when I went to Italy. That I'm part of this zone where people see me as a certain type of player that I'm not.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I am much more than what people want to see. I think going to Italy showed the world what I can do, along with me playing with Belgium. <br>

'Being with my back against the wall is something that I experienced since my youngest age so it's nothing new to me. It is what it is, I accept it.<br>

Lukaku won Serie A with Inter last season, which is his only medal since winning the Belgian league with Anderlecht 11 years earlier.<br>
</p>
<p>
He was at Chelsea when they won the Champions League in 2012, but played no part. 'I was there but I wasn't there,' he smiled. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ahead of this transfer back to the west London club for almost £100million, Lukaku spoke to the likes of Didier Drogba and Thierry Henry. But he says his most eye-opening conversations have been with his new coach, Tuchel.<br>
</p>
<p>
'What I like about him is that for every game there is a different game plan,' Lukaku said. 'That's something I told him in the first conversation we had. I said, ''Look, I have tried to figure out what you try to do with the team but I have never figured it out because every game was different''.<br>
</p>
<p>
'That's what really intrigued me to come and play for him. Because he is a manager who is tactically very, very strong.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He wanted something different to add to the team from what he's got. I think I'm different from all the players that he has.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The No9 shirt that will be worn by Lukaku — perhaps as early as on Sunday at Arsenal — has weighed heavy on previous occupants. Lukaku maybe has more to prove than most who passed before, even if he doesn't yet know it himself.<br>

<h2>
Rio Ferdinand reveals he wanted to join ARSENAL after leaving Manchester United in 2014 but was rejected by Gunners boss Arsene Wenger... and even HE admits it was the right call from the Frenchman!</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/08/46852367-0-image-a-1_1629356838572.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Rio Ferdinand has revealed that he wanted to join Arsenal after leaving Manchester United in 2014 – but was rejected by Arsene Wenger.<br>
</p>
<p>
The United icon was in search of a new club after his deal at Old Trafford expired and he believed he could 'help the dressing room' at Arsenal after years of under-achievement.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, Ferdinand was knocked back by the Gunners' legendary boss, which the former England defender claims was the 'right call' after he went on to struggle at his next club, Queens Park Rangers.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 42-year-old left United after 12 years at the club, winning six Premier League titles and a Champions League, but reveals he was seriously considering a move to one of the club's fiercest rivals.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The maddest thing is I thought about [joining] Arsenal,' Ferdinand said YouTube channel Rio Ferdinand Presents FIVE.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I said, "Arsene, listen, I am leaving Man United and if you want, I will come and try and help the dressing room etc. because I think you need help in that department. I will obviously play but, more importantly, I will come for the culture".<br>
</p>
<p>
'He didn't take me up on the offer and he was right because my performances at QPR weren't up to the levels.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But in the changing room, I believe I could have helped him, because that is where a lot of the culture derives from.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Ferdinand also believes Arsenal's £50million summer signing Ben White needs a new partner in defence after his debut ended in defeat with the Gunners comfortably beaten 2-0 by Brentford last Friday.<br>
</p>
<p>
He said: 'The issue I have with Arsenal is you can't buy players for a year down the line.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Ben White is good now but what you need is someone to come in and grab the players in the training ground.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I feel that at this stage of his career, Ben White needs a partner to bring him a lot, like a Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane or Thiago Silva.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Arsenal have needed a centre-back to come in and defend. If I'm him I'm thinking, "I need some help, I'm getting exposed".'<br>

Nuno Espirito Santo says he'll wait until the weekend to decide if Harry Kane is ready to face Wolves on Sunday, with Tottenham wanting to assess his mental state as well as physical fitness amid push for move to Manchester City</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/19/46830455-0-image-a-35_1629310408051.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Tottenham will assess wantaway Harry Kane's mental state as well as physical fitness before restoring him to Nuno Espirito Santo's side.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane has been left out of Spurs's squad for their Europa Conference League play-off trip to Portuguese side Pacos de Ferreira and instead remained in London to train and continue his bid for full fitness following his extended summer break.<br>
</p>
<p>
He could be involved for the first time this season when Spurs travel to Wolves on Sunday, with former Molineux manager Nuno planning to make a call on Kane's involvement on Saturday.<br>
</p>
<p>
But even if he does feature, the England captain will do so at the centre of the biggest transfer saga of the summer and with huge focus on his attempts to force through a move to champions Manchester City.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nuno said: 'What we must be sure of is that when we decide to put a player on the pitch we have to consider all the aspects.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The fitness aspects, mental aspects and we are here to support all the players, equally and Harry of course has all our support.'<br>
</p>
<p>
As revealed by Sportsmail on Wednesday, Kane believes chairman Daniel Levy has broken a promise to let him leave Spurs this summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane is also thought to believe that the City's latest £125m bid is a good one for Spurs though having already communicated his desire to leave to the board an official transfer request from the 28 year-old to force the issue even more is considered unlikely. <br>
</p>
<p>
Levy's refusal to engage with City, though, has left Kane fearing for his dream move and further underlines their determination to retain their academy graduate.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail understands Spurs are also reinforcing their defiant stance in their transfer talks, reassuring prospective targets that any business they do in the remaining two weeks of this window is not reliant on Kane's sale and maintaining they have no plans to sell their star striker.<br>
</p>
<p>
Spurs reiterating their public stance also in private further has strengthened the belief that their 'not for sale' message is not just a negotiating tactic. <br>
</p>
<p>
Kane, who was not at the stadium for Spurs' 1-0 win against City on Sunday, broke his silence on Wednesday as he stepped up his preparations for the season, tweeting: 'Another session in the bank.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Teammate Ben Davies said: 'He is probably one of the world's best strikers and we definitely want him as part of our team.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We speak regularly, as mates more than anything else. It's probably a blessing when he gets to chat with us, not about the whole business side of it, not about his future. There's been no real chats about what is happening.'<br>

Real Madrid rake in £250m in sales as they fill their 'Kylian Mbappe or Erling Haaland' fund... with Martin Odegaard and Raphael Varane raising £70m alone by moving to Arsenal and Manchester United this summer</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/09/46854989-0-image-a-21_1629362731247.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Real Madrid are reportedly well on their way to funding a record-breaking move for PSG superstar Kylian Mbappe following latest sales to the Premier League.<br>
</p>
<p>
In the last week the Spanish giants have recouped yet more money with the official sale of Raphael Varane to Manchester United, along with an imminent deal to see Martin Odegaard return to Arsenal on a permanent basis.<br>
</p>
<p>
It takes Madrid's transfer fee incomings over the £259million (€300m) mark since the start of last year, and according to Madrid-based daily newspaper Marca this money is being placed straight into a pot to bring Mbappe to LaLiga.<br>
</p>
<p>
Raphael Varane - £40m<br>
</p>
<p>
Martin Odegaard - £30m<br>
</p>
<p>
Achraf Hakimi - £40m<br>
</p>
<p>
Oscar - £13m<br>
</p>
<p>
Takefusa Kubo - £4m (loan fees)<br>
</p>
<p>
Mateo Kovacic - £40m<br>
</p>
<p>
Marcos Llorente - £35m <br>
</p>
<p>
Over the previous 18 months Madrid have seen cash injections following the exits of Achraf Hakimi, Oscar, Sergio Reguilon and now Varane and Odegaardl; three of which are now playing their football in the Premier League.<br>
</p>
<p>
Funds have been raised and huge wages have been shifted off the club's weekly expense bill, including the likes of former captain Sergio Ramos who was told this summer he would not be offered a lucrative new deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Now, Marca claim all Madrid's attention will soon turn to Mbappe, and that the Spanish giants have not ruled out the possibility of also looking to fund a move for Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland. <br>
</p>
<p>
The saving process dates all the way back to the historic sales of Mateo Kovacic and Marcos Llorente, with Madrid's incomings during the same time period being minimal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Not since June 2019 and the signing of Eden Hazard have Madrid shelled out big money on one superstar.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Belgian arrived from Chelsea for an initial fee of £88m on a five-year contract worth more than £400,000 a week, and represented a huge outlay for the Spaniards.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Hazard deal also included numerous clauses which, if all met, could see the deal reach the £150m mark long term.<br>
</p>
<p>
Hazard's underwhelming and injury-hampered time at Madrid since has been well documented, and the LaLiga titans are keen to avoid a repeat in the future. <br>
</p>
<p>
It is understood that Mbappe too would cost huge money, though Madrid are acutely aware that the Frenchman has just 12 months remaining on his PSG deal and would become a free agent next summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
There is a growing belief at the Bernabeu that a deal could even be struck in the final weeks of the current transfer window, with PSG now contending with a vastly inflated wage bill following the sensational arrival of Lionel Messi.<br>
</p>
<p>
As recently reported by Sportsmail, Madrid and PSG are soon set to enter talks regarding the logistics of such a deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, according to Diario AS, PSG have given up the fight to keep Mbappe and are willing to discuss terms of a move away, even considering a deal with Juventus' Cristiano Ronaldo if he leaves.<br>

Millwall boss Gary Rowett's calls for an alternative to taking the knee are set to be IGNORED by the Football League as supporters continue to boo the Black Lives Matter gesture</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/23/46839371-0-image-a-68_1629327501115.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Gary Rowett's plea for an alternative to taking the knee is set to fall on deaf ears.<br>
</p>
<p>
Rowett has come under fire after refusing to condemn Millwall fans who booed Fulham's players as they knelt ahead of their 2-1 win at The Den on Tuesday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Rather than slam his own club's jeering supporters Rowett called on the game's authorities to come up with a 'better way to unify people,' a response that was widely criticised.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 47-year-old said: 'We need the authorities to help clubs out and find a better way to unify people.<br>
</p>
<p>
'At the moment, you know, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, before a game is just causing such a rift and divide.' However, the EFL agreed to continue supporting players who wish to take a knee in protest against after conducting extensive research on anti-discrimination ahead of the new season.<br>
</p>
<p>
In the wide-ranging EFL survey the clear majority of players, managers, clubs and fans backed the taking of the knee - while also reiterating to those who claim otherwise that it is not a political message - and there is no intention of altering their position.<br>
</p>
<p>
Rowett has opted against going against his own supporters whenever the issue has been raised, in all likelihood to avoid leaving himself in a difficult position.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, after Millwall fans booed players who took the knee in protest against racial injustice, discrimination and inequality in December defender Mahlon Romeo said: 'If your beliefs and views oppose a positive change in society then don't come to a football ground and spread them around.<br>
</p>
<p>
'If it's negative, don't think you can come to a football ground and this is the place where you can spread hatred essentially.<br>
</p>
<p>
'What they've done is booed and condemned a peaceful gesture which was put in place to highlight, combat and stop any discriminatory behaviour and racism, which for the life of me I can't understand.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I feel really low - probably the lowest I've felt in my time at this club.<br>
</p>
<p>
'When fans are booing a peaceful gesture to highlight racism, it naturally makes you ask yourself 'why am I putting myself through this?' It [booing] made me feel very small and personally disrespected.'<br>

<h2>
Bring on the super subs? AFC Wimbledon trial use of a SUBSTITUTION coach as League One side look to measure the impact of their changes during matches </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/17/46826425-0-image-m-5_1629303775945.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
AFC Wimbledon are experimenting with utilising substitute coaches as they seek a new avenue to make marginal games during matches.<br>
</p>
<p>
The League One side have given the role to Sammy Lander which is reported to be in place for the season as a way of analysing how best they can make their substitutions.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lander has already been on the bench this term for matches against Charlton Athletic, Doncaster Rovers and Bolton Wanderers and is also performing part-time coaching at the training ground.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lander had approached the League One outfit following research he had compiled on substitutions in the division as well as League Two last term.<br>
</p>
<p>
The former midfielder formerly of Weymouth, admitted the concept came to his attention during his playing days.<br>
</p>
<p>
He told TGG: 'I had the idea for this role after I was drafted onto the bench for Weymouth for one FA Trophy game and the gaffer said, "are you ready?" and I thought "absolutely not."<br>
</p>
<p>
Since retiring as a player, Lander has been an opposition analyst and an assistant first-team coach at Weymouth, as well as a scout at Bournemouth's academy.<br>
</p>
<p>
It was at Weymouth where he would start to inform the bench of opposition subs from his position in the stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
Based on his research he has made a points system based on the impact of the substitution, although concedes that much more research still needs to be done on limited data.<br>
</p>
<p>
It was Wimbledon's openness to new ideas, having appointed a restarts coach last March in Andy Parslow, to approach the club over the idea.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I reached out to Wimbledon and presented them the work I had done,' Lander added. 'They are fantastic, so open-minded.'<br>
</p>
<p>
His matchday activities in the role see him try to make sure subs are fully prepared to come on, mainly by talking to them, but hopes to expand on this as he learns more about being a specialist coach.<br>
</p>
<p>
He admits to having been in touch with Thomas Gronnemark who himself has been a specialist throw-in coach at Liverpool and that his best advice was to 'stick what you believe in.'<br>

<h2>
What next for Cristiano Ronaldo? His statement on his future left more questions than answers and he HAS been offered to Man City... PSG may swoop and pair him with Lionel Messi but is an emotional return to United or Sporting on the cards?</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/11/46814393-0-image-a-51_1629282133018.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Cristiano Ronaldo has seen his old rival Lionel Messi dominate the headlines this summer by joining PSG and could now be nearing a mega move of his own.<br>
</p>
<p>
The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has been linked with some of Europe's top clubs and Juventus are not averse to removing his eye-watering £25.5million-a-year wage from their books. <br>
</p>
<p>
In light of recent speculation, Ronaldo broke his silence by publishing a 286-word statement that left as many questions as it provided answers. <br>
</p>
<p>
He wrote: 'I am committed and prepared for all the challenges that I have to face', in a line that summed up the sentiment of his message without pledging himself to Juventus. <br>
</p>
<p>
In fact, he did not even mention the Italian side. <br>
</p>
<p>
He used most of the statement to reflect on stories connecting him with a return to Real Madrid after Carlo Ancelotti dismissed the idea of a transfer. <br>
</p>
<p>
But the Spanish club are not the only big players in the hunt. PSG are considering an audacious swoop for him, while Manchester City may be the perfect fit as they desperately seek a striker. <br>
</p>
<p>
Manchester United are another of his former clubs in need of a man to lead the line and who better than their favourite son? <br>
</p>
<p>
Perhaps even a return to his boyhood club Sporting Lisbon may be on the agenda for the 36-year-old in the final few years of his career. <br>
</p>
<p>
Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the runners and riders to see where Ronaldo might end up... <br>
</p>
<p>
Could Pep Guardiola, the man so inextricably linked with Lionel Messi at Barcelona, now manage the Argentine's old rival?<br>
</p>
<p>
More to the point, would Ronaldo really betray his United allegiance by joining the blue half of Manchester?<br>
</p>
<p>
Stranger things have happened. Man City are in desperate need of a striker now that Sergio Aguero has departed. <br>
</p>
<p>
Their opening day loss against Tottenham was the clearest evidence yet that Guardiola needs a world class No 9.<br>
</p>
<p>
City are desperate to sign Harry Kane and the England striker wants to join but Daniel Levy is playing hard ball and with the clock of this transfer window ticking down, Guardiola may be forced to look elsewhere. <br>
</p>
<p>
World-class forwards, particularly ones available in the transfer window, are incredibly hard to find so the stars could align here. <br>
</p>
<p>
City are one of the few clubs who could afford Ronaldo's demands and he may even join on a short-term deal. <br>
</p>
<p>
The deal would cost £25m rather than the £150-160m required to secure Kane and with Juventus reeling from losses of £295m due to the coronavirus pandemic, they will want to cash in. <br>
</p>
<p>
It would be a blockbuster transfer and brilliant to see Ronaldo back in the Premier League. <br>
</p>
<p>
Corrierre dello Sport report the Portugal captain and his agent Jorge Mendes are pushing the idea so it is a real possibility but whether he would fit in is another matter. <br>
</p>
<p>
Guardiola's side are a finely tuned machine and Ronaldo is used to teams constructed around his strengths. It would be a fascinating marriage.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Let's be honest, this would be ridiculous. Not impossible, but absurd. To have a team with Ronaldo and Messi, two of the all-time greats, alongside Kylian Mbappe and Neymar seems more like a FIFA career than reality. <br>
</p>
<p>
Fans have always wondered what it might be like to see Messi and Ronaldo in the same side given their enormous influence at Real Madrid and Barcelona when the Clasico rivalry was at its most fierce in recent memory. <br>
</p>
<p>
Perhaps Mbappe is the key here. His contract is running down and Real Madrid hold a long-term interest in the Frenchman. <br>
</p>
<p>
If he was to leave, the Parisians would certainly be in the market for a high-profile replacement. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo's former team-mate Angel di Maria, recently said Ronaldo would be 'dying to join PSG'. <br>
</p>
<p>
Mauricio Pochettino may wait until next summer when the forward's contract expires and there would certainly be questions asked about Financial Fair Play if Ronaldo's enormous wage was added to the bill in the next fortnight. <br>
</p>
<p>
Whether Ronaldo's ego would allow himself to share the limelight with Messi is another matter altogether. <br>
</p>
<p>
There have been times in his career when he's looked bereft when a team-mate scores ahead of him and that would be a regular occurrence in this star-studded outfit.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo to PSG seems more fantasy than reality at the moment but imagine the scenes if he signed...                      <br>
</p>
<p>
As narratives go, this is one of the more compelling. If Ronaldo returned to lead United back out of their Premier League trophy drought, they'd start work on a statue outside Old Trafford immediately. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side look almost perfectly built for an assault on the title this year but could still improve up front. <br>
</p>
<p>
Edinson Cavani can still lead the line superbly but beyond the 34-year-old Uruguayan, the options are unconvincing. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo could solve that problem and the romantic aspect of the transfer would appeal to United fans as much as the fact he would score a bucket full of goals. <br>
</p>
<p>
A one or two-year deal might suit all parties as United would be expected to sign a big name striker next summer. <br>
</p>
<p>
Having already recruited Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho for a combined £111m, it remains to be seen how much is left in the kitty for Solskjaer. <br>
</p>
<p>
The wages could also be an issue as Ronaldo would be likely to come in as the highest earner, which may cause issues with the likes of Paul Pogba, Bruno Fernandes and David de Gea, who are among the best paid at the club. <br>
</p>
<p>
But the lure of United would possibly be greater for Ronaldo that the other clubs vying for his signature. <br>
</p>
<p>
He burst onto the scene at Old Trafford and a return to his old stomping ground might be attractive.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo is known for his incredible professionalism and is still in phenomenal shape but at 36 but at some point time catches up with everyone. <br>
</p>
<p>
He will start to lose a step of pace and his mind may begin to outperform his body. When that will be, nobody knows, but he has spoken in the past about the appeal of sealing an emotional return to boyhood club Sporting. <br>
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, Marca reported that Ronaldo was eager to re-join Sporting when his Juventus contact expires. <br>
</p>
<p>
Financially, the Portuguese club would struggle not only with his £25m fee but also the astronomical wages.<br>
</p>
<p>
But given Ronaldo's enormous wealth and love for the club, perhaps he would be willing to take a pay cut, just as Messi was prepared to do before his departure from Barcelona.<br>
</p>
<p>
He is unquestionably the team's best known player and he developed there as a teenager before United came calling.   <br>
</p>
<p>
It seems unlikely that Ronaldo would join Sporting at this point in time as he is still hungry for major trophies. <br>
</p>
<p>
He could yet have two or three years left at the highest level so a return to the Portuguese capital might be premature. <br>
</p>
<p>
For all the talk and Ronaldo's coy statement, this does seem the most likely answer. <br>
</p>
<p>
Having seen the team unceremoniously dumped from their perch last season by Inter Milan, he may want to see out the final year of his contract and aim to win back the Scudetto. <br>
</p>
<p>
He has not told the club he wants to leave and no official offers have been made. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Italian side still desperately crave a Champions League win and are far more likely to fulfil that ambition with Ronaldo. <br>
</p>
<p>
If he was to depart, they would be unlikely to find an adequate replacement before the window closes and Massimiliano Allegri will want every tool at his disposal. <br>
</p>
<p>
Having said that, financial prudence may prevail. Juventus signed Ronaldo from Real for £100m but they would lose him for nothing next summer so the temptation would be to recoup at least some money for him. <br>
</p>
<p>
The club lost £275m as a result of the pandemic and have been extremely quiet in the transfer market this summer, only signing Italy midfielder Manuel Locatelli from Sassuolo on loan with the obligation to buy. <br>
</p>
<p>
They are keen to tie down Paulo Dybala to a new deal but would only be able to do so with more salary space freed up.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo's departure would give the club some much needed breathing room and if a solution can be found to suit all parties, we might just see a blockbuster late deal before the transfer window shuts.  <br>
</p>

<h2>
Arsenal on the brink of completing their move for Martin Odegaard from Real Madrid in a deal worth £30m plus bonuses as Mikel Arteta returns for the man who impressed on loan at the Emirates Stadium last season </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/17/46828099-0-image-a-22_1629305630283.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Arsenal are set to confirm the £30million arrival of No 1 midfield target Martin Odegaard from Real Madrid — and Sheffield United goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale could soon follow him to north London.<br>
</p>
<p>
Norway international Odegaard was having a medical in London on Wednesday ahead of signing a five-year deal with the club where he spent the second half of last season on loan.<br>
</p>
<p>
Head coach Mikel Arteta had always earmarked the return of Odegaard as a priority signing after a number of impressive displays during his spell at the club last season. <br>
</p>
<p>
But insiders had little confidence that a permanent return could be reached following initial discussions with Real officials earlier this summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Gunners explored a number of alternatives — including Leicester's playmaker James Maddison.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Arsenal have moved quickly to secure the attacking midfielder after Real changed their stance following the arrival of new boss Carlo Ancelotti. The 22-year-old made 20 appearances for Arsenal last season, scoring twice. <br>
</p>
<p>
Provided Odegaard is double jabbed, he could be available for Sunday's clash against Chelsea if registered by midday on Friday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal have also solved their search for a goalkeeper after finalising an initial £24m deal with Sheffield United for Ramsdale, England's third choice at the Euros.<br>
</p>
<p>
He was left out of United's squad for their trip to West Brom last night ahead of his imminent switch.<br>
</p>
<p>
Talks were revived after they stalled last week due to the Blades' demands and the two clubs thrashed out a deal with Ramsdale's move set to be confirmed in the next 48 hours and in time for him to be involved against Chelsea.<br>

Romelu Lukaku says he wants to spend the rest of his career at Chelsea.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 28-year-old Belgium striker has signed a five-year contract after returning to the club he played for 10 years ago. Chelsea have paid almost £100million to bring Lukaku back to the Premier League from Inter Milan.<br>
</p>
<p>
On Wednesday he said: 'It's the right move for me for the rest of my career because, with a lot of maturity and experience, you come back as a player who can hopefully add something to the team. The coach wanted something different to add to the team. I think I'm different from all the players that he has.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea coach Thomas Tuchel hopes Lukaku can bring his incredible Inter scoring record — a goal every game and a half — to Stamford Bridge.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lukaku believes he has nothing to prove after his difficult two years at Manchester United between 2017 and 2019.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I don't have to prove anything to anyone,' he said. 'I have experienced success elsewhere and also a different playing style where it's more technical-based and tactical. The Premier League has a bit of everything and the experiences I had a few years ago were great.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I loved every minute of it but the experiences in Italy made me more complete as a player.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Watching the Premier League over the last few years, the players have got better, the teams have got better and I am ready for the challenge.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Lukaku will wear the No 9 shirt and is available for Sunday's game at Arsenal.<br>

Tottenham 'ready to swoop for long-term Arsenal target Houssem Aouar' from Lyon after the Gunners opted to sign £30m Real Madrid ace Martin Odegaard instead</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/00/46839967-0-image-m-37_1629328291283.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Tottenham are reportedly ready to move for long-term Arsenal target Houssem Aouar.<br>
</p>
<p>
New Spurs boss Nuno Espirito Santo wants to strengthen his attacking options by signing the Lyon playmaker, according to the Daily Mirror.<br>
</p>
<p>
And the Gunners' £30million swoop for Real Madrid midfielder Martin Odegaard has opened the door for their north London rivals to sign the Frenchman.<br>
</p>
<p>
Aouar scored eight goals and provided four assists in 33 appearances for the Ligue 1 side last season.<br>
</p>
<p>
But the 23-year-old is among several Lyon stars placed on the transfer list by Lyon sporting director Juninho.<br>
</p>
<p>
Reports in France claim the Brazilian is so keen to sell Aouar that the club are willing to lower his £25m price tag.<br>
</p>
<p>
Aouar was a top target for the Gunners last summer, but club chiefs failed to thrash out a deal with the French side.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal hope to reach an agreement with Real Madrid this week for the transfer of Norwegian ace Odegaard.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Gunners had opened a dialogue with the Spanish giants earlier in the summer over a permanent deal, after the Norway captain impressed on loan during the second half of last season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Boss Mikel Arteta has remained determined to bring in a playmaker and now Sportsmail understands hands are about to be shaken on a deal worth in the region of £30m (€35m).<br>
</p>
<p>
On Wednesday, Odegaard was absent from Real Madrid's training session, while the fine print of the deal was being discussed. <br>

Ozan Tufan vows to 'do big things in the best league of the world' after joining Watford on season-long loan from Fenerbahce</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/12/46859405-0-image-a-29_1629373386638.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Watford have further added to their Premier League squad with the season-long loan signing of Fenerbahce midfielder Ozan Tufan.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 26-year-old Turkey international has moved to Vicarage Road on a deal which could be made permanent next summer as the Hornets have an option to buy.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tufan has 63 senior international caps to his name and made over 120 appearances for Fenerbahce since joining from Bursaspor in 2015.<br>
</p>
<p>
A versatile defensive-midfielder who can also operate at full-back, Tufan spent the 2018-19 campaign on loan at Alanyaspor and will now be looking to make a name for himself in England.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tufan becomes Watford's third midfield signing of the summer having also signed Juraj Kucka from Parma and Peter Etebo from Stoke, respectively. <br>
</p>
<p>
Xisco Mundoz has also added former Tottenham left back Danny Rose to his squad with the hope avoiding the drop this season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Imran Louza, Emmanuel Dennis, Mattie Pollock, Kwadwo Baah, Joshua King and Ashley Fletcher have all also made the switch to Watford this summer<br>
</p>
<p>
The Hornets marked their return to the Premier League with a win over Aston Villa at Vicarage Road last Saturday. <br>
</p>
<p>
Goals from Emmanuel Bonaventure, Ismaila Sarr and Cucho Hernandez were enough to seal the victory. <br>
</p>
<p>
They travel to Brighton this weekend and will be looking to make it back-to-back victories.  <br>

<h2>
'I was frightened about going to bed because I honestly doubted if I'd wake up in the morning': Shrewsbury manager Steve Cotterill recounts terrifying battle with Covid that pushed him to the brink and left him with pneumonia and a punctured lung</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/17/46826543-0-image-a-7_1629303210654.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Steve Cotterill's voice breaks as he relives the terrifying Covid ordeal that took him to the brink of death.<br>
</p>
<p>
'One night I was petrified of going to sleep because I feared I would never wake up,' recalled Cotterill.<br>
</p>
<p>
When he did open his eyes early one morning, Cotterill realised he had survived a terrifying brush with mortality — and that the worst days were behind him.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Shrewsbury manager, who turned 57 last month, counts himself 'incredibly lucky to have lived to tell the tale' after almost succumbing to coronavirus while in intensive care at Bristol Royal Infirmary.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I've generally got a positive mentality but there was one night when I must admit fearing the worst,' Cotterill told Sportsmail.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I was lying on my bed frightened about going to sleep because I honestly doubted if I'd wake up in the morning.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I was drained but too scared to close my eyes. I was clinging on and it was frightening but I thought, 'I'm not ready to leave my family yet'.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Sleep came and what followed was 'a mixture of relief and exhilaration' as he came through what he describes as 'literally my darkest hour'.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I remember waking up and looking at the clock which said 10 past four,' said Cotterill. 'I slapped my hands together, as if we'd just scored. I spoke to myself, 'What was all the fuss about? That's the end of that drama'.'<br>
</p>
<p>
He is still at a loss to explain why Covid pushed him to the brink after he tested positive on New Year's Day.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Things went downhill after I joined in a training session, which was probably unwise,' said Cotterill. 'I felt really fatigued that evening and woke up in the middle of night with my bed sheets soaking wet. I saw the physio the next morning and a Covid test came back positive.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I isolated in a Shrewsbury hotel for 10 days but became really poorly. I hardly drank or ate. I lost a stone and a half in weight.'<br>
</p>
<p>
One of 17 people in the Shrewsbury camp to be hit in that outbreak, he returned to the family home in Bristol. He was 'effectively force-fed' before 'my coughing was so bad I thought I'd pass out'.<br>
</p>
<p>
He turned to former Bristol City club doctor Jonathan Williams for advice. 'I was finding it harder and harder to breathe and thought, 'My God, I'm in really big trouble here',' said Cotterill.<br>
</p>
<p>
'When I described my symptoms to the doc, he was decisive: 'We need to get you in an ambulance' and that was when it hit home.'<br>
</p>
<p>
With the hospital full, he was stuck in a holding bay for nearly 14 hours, hooked up to oxygen amid a flurry of activity from doctors and nurses 'battling to save lungs under attack'.<br>
</p>
<p>
And so began a journey that as well as Covid-19, included suffering a punctured lung, emphysema and then Covid-pneumonia.<br>
</p>
<p>
Football proved vital to maintaining his sanity while he was afraid and alone in hospital.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I'd have a laugh with the doctors, joking that I felt like a team fighting to get out of the relegation zone,' he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But on a serious note, work gave me a positive focus. I kept in touch with Aaron Wilbraham, my assistant, who bore the brunt, waking up to loads of notes.'<br>
</p>
<p>
To regain fitness, he turned his room into a mini-gym. Eventually allowed to return home, he was 'the happiest guy on the planet'.<br>
</p>
<p>
'My family were all scared witless,' he said. 'I didn't see any of my loved ones face-to-face after I went through the hospital doors because of the tight restrictions.'<br>
</p>
<p>
He was back home for 11 days before being re-admitted on March 1 as his breathing problems returned.<br>
</p>
<p>
He had developed Covid-19 pneumonia but his treatment regime was tweaked and he was discharged and returned to work before the end of last season. Then he focused on making sure he was back in his office for the start of the new season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Now able to reflect on a harrowing journey that saw him away from the club for 69 days, he says he will be 'eternally grateful' for Shrewsbury's support and is determined to pay back chairman Roland Wycherley.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I don't think I'll be back to full health this year,' he said. 'It's been very humbling and I'll remain forever in debt to the doctors and nurses who guided me back to health. They're genuine heroes.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I got 2,000 text messages from people wishing me well. It took a while to go through them but when I did I burst into tears.'<br>
</p>

<h2>
Gazza was adored at Lazio, Juventus fans still revere John Charles as 'the gentle giant', while Platt, Francis and Souness all shone at Sampdoria... so, will Tammy Abraham tear up Serie A at Roma like these fellow Brits did?</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/17/13/46773317-0-image-a-53_1629202283676.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Tammy Abraham will become the latest in a long line of British footballers to play in the Italian top division after he completed his £34million transfer from Chelsea to Roma.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 23-year-old striker will play under former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho at the Stadio Olimpico, with the former Chelsea boss describing the signing as 'a real coup', while Abraham has already spoken about firing his new team to success and silverware.<br>
</p>
<p>
Abraham will play in Roma's No 9 shirt during the forthcoming Serie A campaign and he will be desperate to emulate the achievements of some of the celebrated Brits living la dolce vita on our list here.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lazio 1992-95<br>
</p>
<p>
Gascoigne was the main catalyst for English interest in the Italian game. Two years after his tears on the pitch during England's World Cup semi-final defeat to West Germany in Turin, Lazio paid what was then a huge fee of £5.5million to bring Gazza in from Spurs.<br>
</p>
<p>
An extrovert personality off the field and genius on it, Gascoigne is very much a one-off character and his transfer meant that suddenly millions of English fans were following Lazio's results very closely.<br>
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Channel Four's decision to bid to broadcast Italian football coverage came after Gascoigne, working with TV production company Chrysalis on a documentary, remarked it would be a shame viewers back home couldn't watch him in Serie A.<br>
</p>
<p>
On the field, his three seasons with Lazio were dogged by injury setbacks and inconsistent form - he played only 47 matches and scored just six goals.<br>
</p>
<p>
Gazza struggled to settle in Italy, feeling alone and isolated, and failed to master the language to help his integration. He infamously greeted the Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti by saying 'your daughter has big tits.'<br>
</p>
<p>
He endured a rocky relationship with the Italian press, who sought to unsettle him, though he didn't help himself by belching down a reporter's microphone on live television.<br>
</p>
<p>
In the 1993 pre-season he was so out of shape that Lazio manager Dino Zoff demanded he shed two stone or lose his place in the team.<br>
</p>
<p>
But there were occasional moments of glory. He became a legend to Lazio fans when he scored an 89th-minute equaliser, his first goal for the club, in the derby with Roma in 1992, joyously running to the fans with arms outstretched.<br>
</p>
<p>
John Charles <br>
</p>
<p>
Juventus, Roma 1957-63<br>
</p>
<p>
Almost certainly the best British export to Italy of them all, Charles is still revered as 'the Gentle Giant' by Juventus fans and was just as comfortable at centre back as centre forward.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Welshman commanded a British record fee of £65,000 when Juventus signed him from Leeds United in 1957 though that figure was almost double the previous record.<br>
</p>
<p>
Played up front in a prolific 'Holy Trident' with Giampiero Boniperti and Omar Sivori, Charles scored an astonishing 108 goals in 155 matches for the club over five seasons.<br>
</p>
<p>
In that time, he helped Juventus win the Scudetto three times and the Coppa Italia twice. He was the league's top scorer with 28 in 1957-58 and placed third in the 1959 Ballon d'Or.<br>
</p>
<p>
Boniperti said of his strike partner: 'I would say he was from another world because of his human qualities. John was one of the most loyal and honest people I have ever met, a very special person.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He managed to keep the whole team united, and any quarrels or arguments quietened down as soon as he appeared on the pitch or in the dressing room.'<br>
</p>
<p>
It speaks volumes for the high esteem in which Juventus as a club held Charles that on the occasion of their centenary in 1997, he was voted their best-ever foreign player.<br>
</p>
<p>
He returned to Leeds in 1962 but later returned to Italy for a shorter stint of just 11 games with Roma.<br>
</p>
<p>
Bari, Juventus, Sampdoria 1991-95<br>
</p>
<p>
The antithesis in so many ways to Gascoigne, Platt whole-heartedly embraced the experience of living and playing in Italy and emerged from his four seasons in Serie A with credit.<br>
</p>
<p>
The midfielder's career took on a higher trajectory after his brilliant volley for England against Belgium in the last-16 of the 1990 World Cup - a goal set up, ironically, by Gascoigne's free-kick.<br>
</p>
<p>
'If I hadn't scored that goal, I might still have ended up playing in Italy but, realistically, I'm sure it was the catalyst,' Platt later recalled.<br>
</p>
<p>
Italian clubs were wary of signing English players but Bari, just promoted back into the top flight and with an ambitious president in Vincenzo Matarrese were willing to pay Aston Villa £5.5m for him.<br>
</p>
<p>
Platt's willingness to learn the language and ingratiate himself in Italian culture impressed, as did his dedication on the training ground.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I wanted to become an Italian, speak like an Italian, to live and eat like an Italian,' Platt said. He was fluent in the language within a few months.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mobbed by delighted fans at the airport, Platt didn't exactly lessen the burden on his shoulders by saying he wanted to become the 'Maradona of Bari'. That may explain why he was handed the No 10 shirt.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sadly, Bari suffered relegation but Platt still managed to score 11 league goals - Bari only scored 26 all season - and attracted interest from some of Italy's more prestigious clubs.<br>
</p>
<p>
In the summer of 1992, Platt chose the lure of Juventus over Sampdoria. The Turin club signed him as part of a spending spree that also included Dino Baggio, Gianluca Vialli, Andreas Moller and Fabrizio Ravanelli.<br>
</p>
<p>
Though Juventus won the UEFA Cup, Platt didn't play as regularly as he'd hoped for and, on the suggestion of their skipper Roberto Mancini, he ended up signing for Sampdoria in a £5.2m deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
With future England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson at the helm, Platt excelled and helped them finish third in the league and win the 1994 Coppa Italia.<br>
</p>
<p>
By 1995, Platt was offered a move to Arsenal, the side who had knocked Sampdoria out of the Cup Winners' Cup semi-finals, and he took his chance. Italy was genuinely sad to see him go.<br>
</p>
<p>
There was a postscript, however. Platt was appointed Sampdoria's manager in 1998 but his reign lasted only six matches amid an argument over his coaching qualifications.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Inter Milan 1995-97<br>
</p>
<p>
Ince was playing golf with Ryan Giggs when Alex Ferguson called to inform him Manchester United had accepted an offer from Inter Milan in the summer of 1995.<br>
</p>
<p>
After being wowed by the suave and ambitious Inter president Massimo Moratti, the 'Guv'nor' was on his way to the San Siro in a £7.5m deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Taking a house by the spectacular Lake Como and immersing himself in Italian language and culture, Ince proved a rare positive in a 1995-96 season that saw Inter finish a disappointing seventh.<br>
</p>
<p>
Although he played alongside the likes of Roberto Carlos, Javier Zanetti, Youri Djorkaeff and Ivan Zamarano, Inter were miles behind their neighbours AC Milan, who won the Scudetto.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ince's warrior-like spirit, good engine and eye for a defence-splitting pass earned him adulation and the hard-to-please Inter Ultras used to sing 'Come on Paul Ince, come on'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ince was initially irked that manager Ottavio Bianchi played him on the left wing of a 3-5-2 formation rather than his familiar central midfield role, but once Roy Hodgson came in, all changed for the better.<br>
</p>
<p>
Inter finished third in 1996-97 and reached the final of the UEFA Cup, where they lost out on penalties to Schalke.<br>
</p>
<p>
That summer, Ince decided to return to England and sign for Liverpool, leaving many Inter fans to wonder what might have been. <br>
</p>
<p>
Gerry Hitchens <br>
</p>
<p>
Inter Milan, Torino, Atalanta, Cagliari 1961-69<br>
</p>
<p>
No other British player stayed for as long in Italy as Hitchens, a prolific centre forward who could easily have been part of Alf Ramsey's 1966 World Cup winners if he'd stayed in England.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Hitchens loved the Italian way of life and playing his football in Serie A, where the centre forward from Staffordshire scored prolifically.<br>
</p>
<p>
It was by playing for England against Italy in a Rome international in 1961 that Hitchens, then an Aston Villa player, first became noticed.<br>
</p>
<p>
Inter Milan moved to sign him in the summer of 1961 for £85,000 - another to make the move to Italy that year was Torino's Denis Law - and they were handsomely rewarded with 16 league goals in his first season.<br>
</p>
<p>
He moved on to Torino early the following season and was twice runner-up in the Coppa Italia while at the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
Having played a handful of games for Inter prior to his move, Hitchens was eligible for a Serie A winners' medal in 1962-63. He was the last Englishman to win the Scudetto prior to Ashley Young at Inter last season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Three years with Torino were followed by two at Atalanta and a short stint at Cagliari for this prime Italian convert.<br>
</p>
<p>
Trevor Francis <br>
</p>
<p>
Sampdoria, Atalanta 1982-87<br>
</p>
<p>
Three years after Francis became Britain's first £1million footballer, he was sold by Manchester City to Sampdoria in a deal worth £700,000.<br>
</p>
<p>
It wasn't the most prolific time of his career - 30 goals in 104 games over four seasons - but Francis is fondly remembered for helping Sampdoria lift the Italian Cup for the first time.<br>
</p>
<p>
A team that also included Graeme Souness, Roberto Mancini and Gianluca Vialli defeated AC Milan 3-1 on aggregate to win what was the club's first major honour.<br>
</p>
<p>
Francis played a major role, scoring nine goals in their 11 cup games that season, the most prolific of his time in Italy.<br>
</p>
<p>
Atalanta paid £800,000 for him in 1986 but a return of just three goals in 30 games saw him move back to the UK with Rangers.<br>
</p>
<p>
Graeme Souness <br>
</p>
<p>
Sampdoria 1984-86<br>
</p>
<p>
It makes sense to stick with that same Sampdoria team at this point and the combative Scottish midfielder Souness, who spent two seasons in Genoa.<br>
</p>
<p>
He arrived a European champion after Liverpool beat Roma on penalties in 1984 and though he was 31 at the time, Sampdoria thought nothing of paying £650,000 for his services.<br>
</p>
<p>
Souness proved a necessary experienced head in a youthful side and scored in the first leg of their win over Milan in the Coppa Italia final.<br>
</p>
<p>
He didn't score too many goals but had a knack of coming up with important ones. In the 1984-85 season, Souness scored a winner against Milan in the league and also scored against Roma and Juventus.<br>
</p>
<p>
Souness later revealed the Italian way of playing suited him. 'I went there and found it easy,' he said. 'I found the football easy, it was a bit slower. There wasn't so much pressing.<br>
</p>
<p>
'There, for a midfield player, you could get on the ball a lot easier because they would retreat and back off to their own half and let you have the ball.'<br>
</p>
<p>
After two seasons of a three-year contract, Souness received an offer he couldn't refuse to become player-manager of Rangers, but his fondness for Italy never dwindled.<br>
</p>
<p>
Joe Jordan <br>
</p>
<p>
AC Milan, Hellas Verona 1981-84<br>
</p>
<p>
When Joe Jordan, then on Tottenham's coaching staff, went eyeball-to-eyeball with AC Milan's midfielder enforcer Gennaro Gattuso in 2011, he was simply re-marking out old territory.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Scot played for Milan during the early 1980s, during one of the club's darkest periods that saw them relegated into Serie B. <br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan's 10 goals powered them back into the top flight and put the club on course for later glories.<br>
</p>
<p>
The gap-toothed forward - Italian fans called him Lo Squalo (The Shark) - had signed from Manchester United in 1981 and he mustered just two goals in his first season against Italy's miserly defenders.<br>
</p>
<p>
'They had pride in stopping you, not letting you turn or get shots off, making tackles and not letting you reach a header,' Jordan told Sportsmail in 2018.<br>
</p>
<p>
Having helped Milan win promotion, Jordan moved on to Hellas Verona though he didn't score enough goals to hold down a regular place.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chris Smalling <br>
</p>
<p>
Roma 2019-<br>
</p>
<p>
British players continue to make moves to Serie A and one of the most successful in recent years has been Smalling.<br>
</p>
<p>
Joining Roma, first on loan in 2019 and then permanently in 2020, reinvigorated the defender’s career after he endured a difficult time at Manchester United.<br>
</p>
<p>
There’s not too many Englishmen who can teach the Italians something about the art of defending but Smalling was a rock-solid presence for Roma during his loan, enough to persuade them to stump up £12m to buy him.<br>
</p>
<p>
Injury issues ruined last season for the 31-year-old but he’ll hope for a successful campaign under Mourinho this time around.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ashley Young <br>
</p>
<p>
Inter Milan 2019-2021<br>
</p>
<p>
The third and latest Englishman to win the Scudetto after Jimmy Greaves in 1962 and Hitchens in 1963.<br>
</p>
<p>
Moving to Inter proved a wise choice for Young post-Manchester United and he has played a regular part in the side over the last two seasons at the age of 35/36.<br>
</p>
<p>
The former England wide man has now returned to Aston Villa for a second spell but his two years in Italy can certainly be judged a success.<br>

<h2>
Marcus Rashford 'may return to Manchester United training by the end of the month' with the club 'delighted' with the forward's recovery after undergoing surgery on his long-standing shoulder injury</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/00/46840387-0-image-a-4_1629329105253.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Marcus Rashford could reportedly make a training comeback at Manchester United by the end of the month, weeks before his expected return date, after his surgery.<br>
</p>
<p>
Forward Rashford went under the knife two weeks ago to correct an issue with his shoulder, and his impressive recovery has led United to be hopeful of a return soon.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Sun claim that the 23-year-old may undergo light training inside the next 10 days, with Rashford already working on his build his strength back up.<br>
</p>
<p>
United are said to be 'delighted' with how Rashford has bounced back from the procedure, although their academy graduate is continuing to use a brace.<br>
</p>
<p>
He gritted his teeth to play through the agony during England's Euro 2020 campaign, having initially sustained a muscle tear back in November. <br>
</p>
<p>
It is believed that Rashford is now in less pain, and the same report adds that he is also having two rehabilitation sessions per week.<br>
</p>
<p>
With a specially-designed programme set for the Three Lions man over the next fortnight, United hope he could be available for selection by the end of September. <br>
</p>
<p>
Rashford and his club initially set a return date in October, meaning that the latest development is a promising one as United push for the Premier League title.<br>
</p>
<p>
He has carried out work on the water treadmill, restored back some strength using squats and also worked on his resistance. <br>
</p>
<p>
After heading home following his discharge from hospital, Rashford gave his followers and United supporters an update via social media. <br>
</p>
<p>
Taking to Twitter, he published a photo of himself looking happy and healthy, while beaming into the camera with his left shoulder notably padded up.<br>

<h2>
'Another session in the bank': Harry Kane breaks his social media silence after returning to Tottenham training as he continues his fitness work while his team-mates jet out for Europa Conference League tie without him</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/16/46825563-0-image-a-23_1629301991097.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Harry Kane has taken to social media for the first time since returning to training at Tottenham as he continues to work on his fitness with Manchester City remaining interested in signing him this summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Striker Kane, who is valued at an eye-watering £150million, has been left at home for Spurs' Europa Conference League trip to face Pacos de Ferreira in Portugal this week, and is still under a cloud of speculation.<br>
</p>
<p>
He is yet to play under new boss Nuno Espirito Santo, having only recently returned from a holiday in the Caribbean, and is being put through his paces while he attempts to get back to peak condition for the new season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Despite the dogged links with City, Kane has revealed that he is fully focused on his sharpness, and posted a recent picture of himself training at his club, accompanied by the caption, 'Another session in the bank'. <br>
</p>
<p>
It was not expected that Kane would feature in the tie tomorrow, which marks Spurs' first steps in the newly-launched competition, with Espirito Santo choosing to leave him behind so he can continue working his way back.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane made his comeback to training earlier this week after finishing a period of isolation at the hotel at the club's training complex, and underwent a solo session on Monday before then joining team-mates the day after. <br>
</p>
<p>
Last weekend's Premier League opener against Manchester City arrived too soon for him, despite Espirito Santo previously insisting that Kane was in contention, and he failed to make the matchday squad entirely for the 1-0 win. <br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the off-field tension stemming from his desire to leave his boyhood club is set to continue for the rest of the transfer window. As reported by Sportsmail, Kane believes Daniel Levy has broken a promise to let him go. <br>
</p>
<p>
Sources insisted Kane will continue to work hard at Spurs, despite his belief that they have failed to match his ambition. He was under the impression he would be able to exit if Spurs didn't win a trophy or qualify for the Champions League. <br>
</p>
<p>
As a result, he is still determined to join top-flight champions City before the window slams shut on August 31. Their latest offer is worth £125m, but Spurs are still holding steadfast over their minimum valuation of £150m.<br>
</p>
<p>
Daniel Levy is adamant that Kane is not for sale, a stance which the frontman has viewed as breaking the promise. Kane himself wants to claw back the trust and faith of Tottenham supporters in the meantime.<br>
</p>
<p>
It was also revealed by Sportsmail that Kane was unlikely to make the flight to Portugal today, and indeed that has proved to be the case. Espirito Santo wants him to continue working hard ahead of their next trip to Wolves.<br>
</p>
<p>
City are open to tabling an improved bid before the end of the window, but Pep Guardiola and the Etihad chiefs are wary of dragging the transfer saga into next summer. They were also sensationally offered Cristiano Ronaldo for £25m.<br>
</p>
<p>
Their primary target is Kane, however, who held talks with chairman Levy to air concerns over the direction of Spurs even before last year. It has also surfaced that he has been unsatisfied at the club for the last 18 months.<br>
</p>
<p>
The relationship between Kane and Tottenham has threatened to turn sour and drastically worsen in light of his delayed return to training, but the England captain was adamant that a mix-up in communication was at fault.<br>
</p>
<p>
He has also openly aired his disappointment at his previously sparking reputation taking a hit during City's pursuit of him, and even released a statement on his social media pages that explained he would never refuse to train. <br>
</p>
<p>
'It's almost ten years since I made my Spurs debut,' he said. 'For every one of those years, you – the fans – have shown me total love and support. That's why it hurts to read some of the comments this week, questioning my professionalism.<br>
</p>
<p>
'While I won't go into the specifics of the situation, I want to clarify that I would never, and have never, refused to train. I will be returning to the club tomorrow [Saturday, August 7], as planned.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I wouldn't do anything to jeopardise the relationship with the fans who have given me such unwavering support during my time with the club. This has always been the case as it is today. Harry.' <br>

<h2>
Arsenal set to 'complete move worth up to £30m for Sheffield United's Aaron Ramsdale' with goalkeeper 'close to agreeing terms on a four-year deal to provide competition for Bernd Leno'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/20/46832753-0-image-m-58_1629315369140.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Arsenal are reportedly closing in on sealing the transfer of Aaron Ramsdale from Sheffield United in a move which could eventually rise to £30million.<br>
</p>
<p>
The goalkeeper has been a target for boss Mikel Arteta throughout the summer, and the Blades goalkeeper appears to now be nearing a move to north London having impressed in the Premier League with United despite relegation last term.<br>
</p>
<p>
According to the Athletic, Ramsdale - part of England's Euro 2020 squad earlier this summer - will pen a four-year-deal with an option for a fifth year subject to agreeing personal terms and a medical.<br>
</p>
<p>
The report adds that although the transfer fee is expected to be around £24million, £6m could be paid in add-ons depending on if he eventually forces current No 1 keeper Bernd Leno out of the first team.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sheffield United manager Slavisa Jokanovic didn't select Ramsdale for his side's Championship clash with West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday night, saying he was 'simply not in the right state of mind' to play. <br>
</p>
<p>
'We felt he was not ready for the game,' Blades boss Jokanovic told Sky Sports. 'We took the decision not to use him for the game.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He's simply not in the right state of the mind. We prefer not to complicate things and start with Mike (Verrips).'<br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking after United's 4-0 defeat by West Brom, Jokanovic added: 'The deal is not complete but it's agreed between the clubs. I believe the agreement is close to being done but it can be soon.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's not really what I want but it's difficult to stop this kind of situation. It's a huge deal for the club.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal have opted for a British-based goalkeeper to join the club after initially looking at Ajax's Andre Onana, with Ramsdale and West Brom's Sam Johnstone both heavily linked.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Gunners have already seen two bids for the Englishman rejected, and will hope that this is a case of third time lucky as Mikel Arteta looks to strengthen his squad before the window shuts.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal started the season poorly on Friday night in the Premier League's opening game after they were beaten 2-0 at new boys Brentford.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Gunners faced heavy criticism for their defending during the encounter, in particular the second goal where Leno and his defenders allowed the ball to bounce in the six-yard box from a throw-in before conceding.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jamie Carragher labelled Arsenal's performance 'weak', opining that the top-flight newcomers 'bullied' their more established rivals at the Brentford Community Stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
'How do you describe Arsenal's defending here? It's just Arsenal. Weak, bullied, men against boys again. New season same old story,' he said on commentary duty for Sky Sports.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Spurs have it that people say it's 'Spursy'. I think it's about time Arsenal have something like that as well. Because this is just an Arsenal performance. Everyone knows what that means; an Arsenal performance.'<br>
</p>
<p>
But Arsenal have now moved and also look set to add Martin Odegaard as well as Ramsdale to the list of summer arrivals that already includes Ben White, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Nuno Tavares.<br>

<h2>
Phil Jones was backed by Alex Ferguson to become a Man United club legend and compared him to Duncan Edwards, but constant injury setbacks prevented his potential being fulfilled... Now fit again, how big a part will he play in Solskjaer's plans?</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/11/46815525-0-image-a-38_1629284157220.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
'You saw Jones tonight. Arguably, the way he is looking, he could be our best-ever player.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Sir Alex Ferguson was speaking amid the jubilation of Manchester United's 13th Premier League title win in 2013.<br>
</p>
<p>
His own personal legacy long since secure, his wildly successful 27-year mission complete, Ferguson believed he was handing United over in good shape.<br>
</p>
<p>
He thought Phil Jones would be one of the pillars of a continued dynasty of glory at Old Trafford. It was a time when the strapping and brave England international, then 21, was being compared through misty eyes to Duncan Edwards.<br>
</p>
<p>
Equally capable of playing at centre-half or right-back, Jones was even trusted by Ferguson to play in midfield to counter Sami Khedira and Xabi Alonso in a Champions League tie with Real Madrid.<br>
</p>
<p>
There seemed no ceiling to his career trajectory but unfortunately football has a habit of kicking you in the knackers.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jones has suffered repeatedly with injury setbacks. Transfermarkt lists 23 separate issues during his United career, the latest being the serious knee injury he has spent the past 18 months battling back from.<br>
</p>
<p>
It means a decade at United has seen Jones play 224 times, less than half the games the team has played.<br>
</p>
<p>
In the 2013-14 campaign, he featured in 39 games but hasn't topped 30 since, amid what must feel like a recurring nightmare of his body breaking down and yet more patient recuperation in the gym.<br>
</p>
<p>
And in the meantime, United had little choice but to move on without him. The managers post-Fergie - in particular Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho - all had their own interpretations of what made a suitable centre-half.<br>
</p>
<p>
It saw van Gaal spend £18million on Marcos Rojo and Mourinho sanction the £30m purchase of Eric Bailly and £31m on Victor Lindelof.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's time has seen £80m splashed out on Harry Maguire and now £42m on Raphael Varane, unveiled to rapturous acclaim before the 5-1 win over Leeds on Saturday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Had Jones stayed injury-free, he could easily have been the mainstay of United's defence all the way though that period and United would have saved millions. But it wasn't to be.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jones is now fit again following knee surgery in June last year and another year of pain-staking recovery after that. He made a 30-minute comeback in a behind-closed-doors friendly against Burnley at Old Trafford on Tuesday.<br>
</p>
<p>
It was his first match action since a mud-stained outing at Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup fourth round back in January last year.<br>
</p>
<p>
There has been talk of a move away from United but Jones will be staying for this season and intends to fight for some game time.<br>
</p>
<p>
He will be fifth-choice centre-back in Solskjaer's squad behind Maguire, Varane, Bailly and Lindelof but United will compete in four competitions as always so there should be an opportunity for game time but barring an injury crisis, it is likely to be limited.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail understands Varane didn't ask for Jones's No 4 shirt but it's clear the first-choice partnership for Solskjaer will be the captain Maguire and the French World Cup winner.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jones, who earns £130,000-a-week, has two more years on his four-year United contract signed as recently as February 2019.<br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer has shown faith in the defender during his lengthy recovery but his injury record would certainly have made him a gamble to any club interested in him.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I've had similar troubles [with injury] in my career,' Solskjaer said of Jones recently. 'He's such a professional, good lad, and it's great to see him ready to train again and then hopefully get game time soon.<br>
</p>
<p>
'If he can play in the Under-23s to start with, or we can arrange something behind closed doors for him, because I know exactly the feeling of being out for so long. You just want to feel your way in.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He's always served the club, but it was time for him to look after himself and his own health.'<br>
</p>
<p>
So we can expect to see Jones getting back up to speed in the Under-23 side with the hope of a first team return in the autumn.<br>
</p>
<p>
His last few outings before the Tranmere game weren't great, with Solskjaer at the wheel full-time but struggling to keep United on course.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jones played in a 3-3 draw at Sheffield United in which they fell two goals behind before mounting a thrilling comeback to lead before Oli McBurnie scored in the last minute.<br>
</p>
<p>
There was also a Carabao Cup semi-final in which United were schooled by Man City and a 2-0 home defeat to Burnley which represented a nadir in Solskjaer's reign. Significant progress has been made since that low point with United title contenders again.<br>
</p>
<p>
With his facial gurning as he chases after opponents and the ball, Jones is sometimes a figure of fun for the social media meme generation of football fans.<br>
</p>
<p>
But it takes an especially strong character to come back from so many injury blows during what should be the pomp of his career.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jones has always been bullish about his record, saying: 'People can make their own opinions up, people can talk.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Ultimately I've won the Premier League, been to two World Cups, been to a Euros, played in the Champions League, won the Europa League, the FA Cup.<br>
</p>
<p>
'They are the stats. That's what I have done.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Jones can be viewed as one of the last remaining links to a time when United did actually win silverware on a regular basis. That experience could prove invaluable in Solskjaer's dressing room at crunch moments this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
It doesn't look too likely Jones will become a club legend as Ferguson predicted but it is to be hoped he remains free of injury to enjoy a productive second phase to his career.<br>
</p>

Celtic 2-0 AZ Alkmaar: Kyogo Furuhashi and James Forrest strikes put Scottish side on brink of Europa League group stage after cruising to first leg play-off victory at Parkhead</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/21/46835437-0-image-a-2_1629319624810.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Nothing is guaranteed. Least of all when it comes to a Celtic team who seem intent on hitting the gamble button regardless of scoreline or circumstances.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Ange Postecoglou’s free-wheeling entertainers will head to the nation that gave the world Total Football confident in their ability to complete their Europa League mission. In a style entirely befitting the setting, if Wednesday night is anything to go by.<br>
</p>
<p>
They travel to Holland in possession of a 2-0 lead over AZ Alkmaar, a team who must be wondering what hit them. And possibly feeling a little baffled that they didn’t manage to land at least one blow on their assailants. <br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Celtic (4-3-3): Hart 7; Ralston 7, Starfelt 6, Welsh 6, Taylor 6; Rogic 7 (McCarthy 74), McGregor 7, Turnbull 6 (Soro 88); Abada 6 (Edouard 58), Kyogo 8 (Montgomery 74), Forrest 7.<br>

</p>
<p>
Man of the match: Kyogo Furuhashi.<br>
</p>
<p>
Referee: Ovidiu Hategan (Romania).<br>
</p>
<p>
The Dutch may point to a string of chances to punish Celtic for their high-risk approach.<br>
</p>
<p>
When it came to carving out opportunities, though, they played a poor second fiddle to their hosts. And their inability to hit the net is likely to cost them dear.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kyogo Furuhashi’s goal after just 11 minutes, his sixth in his opening half-dozen games for Celtic, and a deflected James Forrest effort just after the hour-mark did the damage on the night.<br>
</p>
<p>
But there was so much more to this game than just a couple of finishes separating two decent teams. As anyone in attendance would testify.<br>
</p>
<p>
With just over 20 minutes remaining and their team 2-0 up, the Celtic fans here briefly indulged in the ever-popular ‘Poznan’ chant that involves everyone turning their back on play.<br>
</p>
<p>
Only briefly, though. Because very few in attendance could tear their attention away from such madcap entertainment - a feat akin to refusing the urge to chew on a fruit pastille. Impossible. <br>
</p>
<p>
From first minute til last, this was a breathless, thrilling, tense and terrific bit of entertainment.<br>
</p>
<p>
We’ve all learned by now that this Celtic team can only exist on the very edge of the dividing line between triumph and disaster; Postecoglou makes a virtue out of his refusal to playing the percentages.<br>
</p>
<p>
As hard as that might be on the nerves of supporters, they’re surely growing accustomed to the risk-and-reward approach that saw AZ come perilously close to taking the lead twice within the opening five minutes.<br>
</p>
<p>
First the energetic and athletic Zakaria Aboukhlal just seemed to run out of steam at the end of a lighting counter-attack, stumbling over in the box with recovering defenders making their presence felt.<br>
</p>
<p>
Moments later, Joe Hart got maybe a couple of toes - or half a long stud - on the ball to deny Evangelos Pavlidis from a position straight in front of goal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Set up by another Aboukhlal break and a perfect cross from Dani de Wit, Pavlidis looked on in disbelief as his low shot was diverted on to the post and then across the goal line.<br>
</p>
<p>
This was already shaping up to be a shoot-out. With Celtic guaranteed not to be found wanting when it came to taking a pop.<br>
</p>
<p>
Put a sublime chance creator like Tom Rogic and a clever striker like the perpetually-in-motion Furuhashi on the same park and, well, things are going to happen. <br>
</p>
<p>
Just moments before they combined for the opening goal, a Rogic through ball forced Timo Letschert to make a timely intervention to prevent the new fans’ favourite from getting a shot away.<br>
</p>
<p>
Unlucky once, the pair were determined to keep trying. And so produced a delicious opener.<br>
</p>
<p>
Rogic casually playing keepy-up before spinning, rolling and driving to the bye line on the left flank was impressive enough.<br>
</p>
<p>
Furuhashi then darting into the only place Rogic would look to send his delivery, getting the jump on the AZ back four and arriving just in time to send a volley into the roof of the net, was a moment of quality befitting almost any stage. <br>
</p>
<p>
For a spell just after the goal, Australian playmaker Rogic was in his absolute pomp, finding all sorts of angles - and inventing a few not on the compass - from which to bisect the visiting defence. <br>
</p>
<p>
Both Rogic and the lively Liel Abada had shots spilled by AZ keeper Hobie Verhulst, who did well just to prevent both efforts from finding the back of the net.<br>
</p>
<p>
Verhulst also pulled off a spectacular one-handed stop from Forrest, who had cut in from this starting position out left to send a right-footed effort curling towards the far top corner.<br>
</p>
<p>
This was breathless stuff. And, with AZ still looking more than capable on the break, it was tempting to suggest that Celtic should have handed out tranquillisers to supporters upon entry.<br>
</p>
<p>
Never mind questions over how long these players might maintain this up-tempo approach to games. There are fans who won’t make it to October without a rest.<br>
</p>
<p>
Having gone in without a goal to show for their considerable first-half efforts, Alkmaar emerged looking doubly determined after the break.<br>
</p>
<p>
Celtic were constantly having to cope with quick counter-attacks and probing through balls.<br>
</p>
<p>
Had right-back Thijs Oosting hit the target instead of blazing over the bar, or Aboukhlal’s shot not been deflected into the side-netting, the visitors would have argued that they deserved to be on level terms.<br>
</p>
<p>
But they didn’t find a finish to go with all their best intents. And Postecoglou, obviously concerned by his team giving up chances, decided to make the inevitable change.<br>
</p>
<p>
What? You expected him to throw on a holding midfielder to take the sting out of the game?<br>
</p>
<p>
No chance. Off came winger Abada. And on went Odsonne Edouard, with Furuhashi moving to the left in order to make room for another striker.<br>
</p>
<p>
Big Ange’s doubling down paid off almost immediately, as the change of attacking focus set AZ back on their heels - and created the room for a second goal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Furuhashi will be credited with the assist for a ball through the legs of a defender and into the feet of Forrest, who pinned his defender on the six-yard line before spinning and letting rip with a left-footed shot that took a wicked deflection off Letschert to spin beyond Verhulst.<br>
</p>
<p>
AZ continued to chase the game, of course, knowing that even a single goal might give them just enough to build on next week,<br>
</p>
<p>
Yet both Edouard and young Adam Montgomery saw efforts cleared off the line in a desperate late scramble.<br>
</p>
<p>
Right until the final minute of the five added on by referee Ovidiu Hategan, there was the potential for more. More goals, more thrills, more mayhem. At both ends.<br>
</p>
<p>
Don’t miss the second leg. It could be an absolute scream.<br>

Champions League round-up: Benfica, Young Boys and Malmo boost hopes of booking place in group stage after first-leg victories in play-off round ties </h2>

<p>
Benfica closed in on a Champions League group stage berth with a 2-1 home win over PSV Eindhoven and 10-man Young Boys beat Ferencvaros 3-2 in the first legs of their play-off ties on Wednesday.<br>
</p>
<p>
In the day's other clash, goals from Veljko Birmancevic and Jo Inge Berget helped Malmo to a 2-0 victory over visiting Ludogorets Razgrad.<br>
</p>
<p>
Rafa Silva gave Benfica a 10th-minute lead against PSV in a clash of former European Cup winners and Julian Weigl made it 2-0 before Cody Gakpo pulled one back for the Dutch side.<br>
</p>
<p>
PSV were on the front foot in the second half and only a string of superb saves from home goalkeeper Odisseas Vlachodimos denied them an equaliser.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ferencvaros took an early lead at Young Boys through Franck Boli, who salvaged the Hungarian side's hopes of advancing when he pulled it back to 3-2 after the home team had turned the match on its head.<br>
</p>
<p>
After Meschack Elia had levelled for Young Boys, Myrto Uzuni missed a penalty for Ferencvaros, with the incident also producing a straight red card for home defender Silvan Hefti who hauled down Endre Botka.<br>
</p>
<p>
A Vincent Sierro volley and a fine low shot by Ulisses Garcia gave Young Boys a 3-1 lead before Boli struck with a thunderbolt from 20 metres for the visitors.<br>
</p>
<p>
Malmo dominated Ludogorets and Birmancevic fired them ahead with a first-time shot in the 26th minute before Berget slid in to scramble in a rebound on the hour.<br>

Edu is slammed for Arsenal's 'LAZY' recruitment policy by Paul Merson, as he points finger at technical director for deals that have 'left Mikel Arteta behind' and says club only signed Willian and David Luiz because they're 'cheap'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/15/46822019-0-image-a-1_1629296660371.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Arsenal legend Paul Merson has hit out at the club's transfer policy under technical director Edu, claiming they have been guilty of 'lazy recruitment' that has 'left Mikel Arteta behind'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The club have come under fire just one game into the season after their dismal 2-0 defeat to Brenford last week, with Arteta's men having no answer to the newly-promoted outfit and leaving fans furious with the board over the state of the squad.<br>
</p>
<p>
And Merson, who played 423 times for the Gunners, said the situation was 'worrying' and questioned the logic behind some of their recent signings - including free transfers Willian and David Luiz, calling them 'quick fixes'. <br>
</p>
<p>
'It's worrying at Arsenal,' he told Sky Sports. You're still thinking: "Where are they going?" Edu has come in, and the recruitment has been lazy, if I'm being honest. It's been: "Oh, we'll take Willian on a free… we'll take David Luiz for cheap."<br>
</p>
<p>
'I remember years ago in football, managers were judged on signings. Sometimes I think Arteta is left behind, and I'm not sure how much of a say he has got in all of this.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Merson also criticised the club for sanctioning the sale of midfielder Joe Willock to Newcastle, and questioned why they were willing to sell talented stars for modest amounts but pay top wages for players at the end of their careers. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Why would you let Joe Willock go? I'm not saying he's the answer, but he's come through the club and is going for £25million. That sort of money isn't going to change Arsenal,' he added. 'It's not like a Harry Kane or Jack Grealish sale where you get £100m and can rebuild the team. <br>
</p>
<p>
'But Arsenal are prepared to pay Willian big money. Where is the future in that? It's quick fixes. Surely Willock is a future player and for the present, and can be involved in the plan. My question to Edu would be: "What's the plan?"' <br>
</p>
<p>
Arteta has become one of the early favourites for the sack after the nature of Arsenal's opening day loss to Brentford, but Merson was not left surprised by the performance, calling it 'predictable', and said supporters had to accept that the glory days under Arsene Wenger were long gone.<br>
</p>
<p>
He believes the Gunners were 'outfought and outthought' by the inexperienced Bees and was left baffled by their lack of organisation and gameplan. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I think we got spoiled with Arsenal 20 years ago,' the former midfielder said. 'Those days are gone. 2004 is gone. We're all still living in the past with Arsenal. But look where they are - this is Arsenal, now.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I thought Friday was very predictable. There was no change. You could see what was happening, but it didn't feel like Arsenal knew what was happening - that was the most worrying thing for me.<br>
</p>
<p>
Brentford did their homework. They had a Plan A and a Plan B. They got the ball up to Ivan Toney, who caused havoc. Ben White has got a load of stick, but I think it should have been nipped in the bud from source.  <br>
</p>
<p>
'I just thought Arsenal got outfought, outthought, everything. I don't even think Brentford were mind-blowing, and I think they'll play better this season!'<br>

<h2>
Lautaro Martinez 'set to sign new five-year Inter Milan contract worth £5m per season'... with Nuno Espirito Santo's £60m plans to pair him with Harry Kane at Tottenham scuppered by Romelu Lukaku's move to Chelsea</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/16/46824237-0-image-a-17_1629299772586.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Lautaro Martinez is reportedly close to agreeing a new five-year deal with Inter Milan despite interest from Tottenham. <br>
</p>
<p>
The first meeting between the striker and the Serie A side had been planned for some weeks and was 'positive', according to Sky Sports Italia.<br>
</p>
<p>
Martinez's current contract runs until 2023 and the Argentine is still on the same €2.5million (£2m) per-season salary he was on when he signed from Racing in 2018.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 25-year-old's new contract is expected to be a five-year deal worth £5.1m per season. <br>
</p>
<p>
After playing a pivotal role in Inter's Serie A title win  and Argentina's Copa America victory, Martinez has attracted the interest of Tottenham and Atletico Madrid. <br>
</p>
<p>
Tottenham had reportedly agreed a £60m fee for the forward as head coach Nuno Espírito Santo plotted to create a deadly partnership up front with Manchester City target Harry Kane.<br>
</p>
<p>
There was hope Spurs could see their swoop for Martinez completed but that was before the move hit complications owing to the return of Chelsea's prodigal son Romelu Lukaku. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, Sportsmail understands that Tottenham struck their deal with Inter for Martinez before Chelsea came in aggressively to seal their £98m club record move for Lukaku at the end of last week - a scenario that casts some doubt over Spurs' move for the South American. <br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea's signing of Lukaku, which saw him return to Stamford Bridge seven years after he first left, scuppered their London rivals' chances of securing Martinez's signature.<br>
</p>
<p>
While Inter are in severe financial difficulty, the Italian club would be reluctant to lose both their main forwards. <br>
</p>
<p>
Martinez’s partnership with Lukaku saw the pair contribute 41 goals and 20 assists to Inter's Scudetto campaign that saw them finish above rivals AC Milan by 12 points. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Nerazzurri ended Juventus's vice-like grip on the Serie A to win their first title in a decade and Simone Inzaghi's side will be looking to retain their crown this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Now, having made back £150 million in transfer fees, they no longer have a desperate need to sell Martinez. <br>
</p>
<p>
Martinez's agent Alejandro Camano looked to dampen talk of his Milan exit, telling FCInter1908.it: 'He's never gonna have a fight with Inter to leave the club. Never. Lautaro's an Inter player and he's happy in Italy.' <br>

Former Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov admits 'it is no surprise that Harry Kane is p****d off' but brands the Spurs talisman and his representatives as 'naive' in how they have negotiated with chairman Daniel Levy over potential exit to Manchester City</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/18/46829579-0-image-a-24_1629308540324.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Former Tottenham Hotspur striker Dimitar Berbatov believes Harry Kane has been 'naive' in his approach to leave the club this summer, but understands his frustrations.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane was a late arrival back for pre-season, and as a result of missing training sessions was unavailable for Spurs' first game of the season in the 1-0 win over Manchester City.<br>
</p>
<p>
The striker has also been left behind for Spurs' trip to Pacos Ferreira in the Europa Conference League in Portugal on Thursday, fuelling more speculation over a proposed £150million move to City having requested to leave north London late last season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Berbatov's time at Spurs ended in 2008 when he forced through a summer deadline day move to Manchester United for £31m after Spurs chairman Daniel Levy held the Red Devils firm in negotiations and he admits he can understands Kane's fury. <br>
</p>
<p>
'If they did speak at the end of last season and they had a gentleman's agreement which has been broken, it isn't a great situation and it's no surprise that Kane is p****d off, he told betfair.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I have been in this situation and all I have to say is that they should have expected and anticipated this.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Kane's team shouldn't have been so naïve with this situation because football is a business.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Of course, we like that gentlemen's style of shaking hands and saying, "yes, you have my word", but sometimes in football it doesn't work like this and you get angry.<br>
</p>
<p>
'You have to expect for these things to happen and plan how to avoid it or react to it when it happens.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane has taken to social media for the first time since returning to training at Tottenham as he continues to work on his fitness.<br>
</p>
<p>
He is yet to play under new boss Nuno Espirito Santo, having only recently returned from a holiday in the Caribbean, and is being put through his paces while he attempts to get back to peak condition for the new season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Despite the dogged links with City, Kane has revealed that he is fully focused on his sharpness, and posted a recent picture of himself training at his club, accompanied by the caption, 'Another session in the bank'.<br>
</p>
<p>
It was not expected that Kane would feature in the Conference League tie, which marks Spurs' first steps in the newly-launched competition, with Espirito Santo choosing to leave him behind so he can continue working his way back.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane made his comeback to training earlier this week after finishing a period of isolation at the hotel at the club's training complex, and underwent a solo session on Monday before then joining team-mates the day after.<br>

Manchester City 'in talks with Ruben Dias over new deal worth up to £250,000-per-week' after stunning first season... and the contract could see defender 'extend his stay to 2027'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/00/46839809-0-image-a-27_1629328913846.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Manchester City are reportedly already in talks over extending the contract of star defender Ruben Dias - just a year after the defender joined the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
Dias arrived as a £61million signing from Benfica and was a star in the City backline that stormed to the Premier League title and the Champions League final.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 24-year-old's impact was so impressive, he ended the season picking up the Premier League player of the year award.<br>
</p>
<p>
Now according to the Sun, City are ready to reward their star centre-back, who also featured for Portugal at Euro 2020 this summer, with talks having started over extending his £90,000 by a further year to the end of the 2026-27 season while also improving his basic wage.<br>
</p>
<p>
The report adds that his new wage could put him on par with centre-back partner John Stones, who penned a similar deal worth £250,000-per-week earlier in August.<br>
</p>
<p>
Dias featured 51 times for City in his maiden campaign and along with Stones was key to a defence which conceded just 32 times last term in the Premier League.<br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, manager Pep Guardiola is looking to continue strengthening his side in attack in pursuit of Tottenham striker Harry Kane, who remains first choice to replace Sergio Aguero after the club's record goalscorer departed the Etihad Stadium in the summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane has accused the north London club of a broken promise in refusing to let him leave after failing to win a trophy or qualify for the Champions League last term, with City having made an offer worth up to £125million.<br>
</p>
<p>
Should City fail in their bid to land Kane before the deadline at the end of the month, then they could be tempted by an audacious swoop for Cristiano Ronaldo.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail understands that the Juventus forward has been offered to City as well as other clubs in Europe for as little as £25million, but the Premier League champions have made Kane their No 1 target. <br>

<h2>
A kit like no other! Man City unveil 'striking' third strip which is set to divide fans this season - with bizarre design dropping the badge from the front and featuring the club's name in large letters instead</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/18/18/46829707-0-image-a-39_1629308895797.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Manchester City have officially unveiled their ground-breaking new third kit for this season, but the design has all but removed their club badge from the front.<br>
</p>
<p>
Puma, who have also put together City's two other strips, opted to take a leap into the unknown for their latest creation and have marketed it as being 'progressive'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The jersey marks a departure from the traditional uniform sported by clubs around the world, with City's badge not featured prominently and their name used instead.<br>
</p>
<p>
Taking on a navy blue sheen, the general look of the design appears simple enough, but closer inspection reveals their badge dotted about the shirt.<br>
</p>
<p>
And in its place, the words 'Man City' are emblazoned across the front in sky blue, with the Puma logo and Etihad Airways sponsor above and below respectively. <br>
</p>
<p>
The crest in its usual form has been moved to the back of the neck, and the shirt is accompanied by navy blue shorts and similarly coloured socks.<br>
</p>
<p>
Puma have opted for a similar layout for many of the clubs they make kits for this term, with AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund among those boasting the same design. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ederson, City's first-choice goalkeeper, and his team-mates between the sticks will pull on a shirt of an identical template, but instead it will be mint green. <br>
</p>
<p>
Revealing the concept for the first time, Puma explained that they aimed to 'challenge convention, innovate, and bring fresh products to football'.<br>
</p>
<p>
In a statement, they said the kit 'creates a new expression of the club's identity on the front of the jersey by reimagining the traditional football kit in a brand-new approach merging football and streetwear culture.'<br>
</p>
<p>
They have also revealed all on the benefits of the kit, with its unique design helping to keep athletes 'dry and comfortable' as well as enhance 'breathability'. <br>
</p>
<p>
Regardless of the sporting advantages, the design has split City's fanbase, although midfielder, and captain, Fernandinho has been left impressed.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I wanted something different, and we definitely got that. I really like the design because the badge may change over time, but the name will live on forever', he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
Carl Tuffley, senior head of design manager Teamsport, said their objective was to go against the 'traditional football jersey design'.<br>
</p>
<p>
He added: 'It is easy to play safe, but we want to change perceptions of a conventional football jersey. The Third kit presented an opportunity to be bold, so we wanted to re-energise these jerseys and take a new direction.'<br>
</p>
<p>
But supporters are not happy, and took to social media in their droves to air their bemusement and disgust with Puma's newest offering.<br>
</p>
<p>
A number of them have even described the design as 'the worst' in the club's history.<br>
</p>
<p>
'This is the worst kit in our history, surely,' one fan has said. <br>
</p>
<p>
Another adopted a similar tone, writing: 'This is the worst kit I have ever had the displeasure of looking at. Genuinely staggering that Puma had a meeting about this and everyone was in favour of this design.'<br>
</p>
<p>
A third, meanwhile, posted: 'I don't want to come across like I've overreacting here or anything, but that is categorically the worst kit I've ever seen.' <br>
</p>
<p>
'I can't wait for this to be in the clearance bin for 4.99 at the end of the season so I can still not buy it,' said a fourth. 'Appalling.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Another accused City of pushing 'the boundaries too much', and added: 'This should have been a training kit, nothing more or less.' <br>
</p>
<p>
A sixth said: 'Absolutely dreadful. Massive misjudgement by City and Puma. The badge means everything! Worst kit ever.' <br>
</p>
<p>
The strip was launched alongside nine other kits for clubs around Europe in a special digital event named 'The Show', which was streamed live this evening. <br>
</p>
<p>
Puma's home shirt for City paid tribute to Sergio Aguero's goal against QPR which clinched the club the Premier League title in 2012.<br>
</p>
<p>
The away kit, which is a white design with purple and blue trim, was well received by supporters, meanwhile.<br>
</p>
<p>
As for AC Milan's third strip, which is the same design as City's, albeit in a black colour', Olivier Giroud was pictured sporting it for the release.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sporting a wide grin, towering target man Giroud pointed at a pair of boots, and showed off the kit in its entirety. It features the words AC Milan across the front.<br>
</p>
<p>
Also plastered across the whole of the design is the club's crest, in a similar style to City, and once again the Puma logo takes up space in the centre. <br>

Antoine Griezmann 'targets 100 more games at the Nou Camp' after notching his first century of appearances... despite Barcelona desperately trying to offload the £294,000-a-week forward as they look to wipe £1.15BILLION debt</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/19/10/46855511-0-image-a-32_1629363861800.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Antoine Griezmann has set his sights on the next 100 games with Barcelona, despite reported interest from Atletico Madrid and Manchester City this summer.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The Frenchman is targeting the long-term stay at the Nou Camp after reaching the milestone this weekend. <br>
</p>
<p>
The forward hit the century mark after he started in the Blaugrana's 4-2 season-opening win against Real Sociedad on Sunday. <br>
</p>
<p>
But Barcelona are desperate to shift Griezmann to ease their financial difficulties. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I am proud and happy to have reached this figure,' Griezmann told the club's official site.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I hope I get to play another 100 games and carry on giving everything to make history with this club,' he added.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I want to keep helping the team both on and off the pitch, in attack and defence, and enjoying being at Barca.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Of his 100 appearances, 78 have been in LaLiga, with 16 in the Champions League, nine in the Copa del Rey and three in the Spanish Super Cup. <br>
</p>
<p>
Griezmann has scored 35 goals in his 100 games for Barcelona since arriving in 2019, needing 14 more to equal Thierry Henry's record of 49 as the club's all-time leading French goal scorer. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, it is no secret Barcelona are struggling under the pressure of their £1.15billion debt after the club was forced to let Lionel Messi leave for PSG as they could no longer foot the bill of his wages. <br>
</p>
<p>
Griezmann is one of the club's highest earners pocketing £294,000 per week and the Catalans are desperate to get him off their books. <br>
</p>
<p>
The World Cup winner arrived at the Nou Camp at an arguably cut-price deal of £108m from Atletico Madrid. <br>
</p>
<p>
But with his mammoth wages and three years left on his contract Barcelona need to shift him in order to make a dent in their debt.<br>
</p>
<p>
Barcelona have signalled they are open to selling the 30-year-old amid interest from Atletico and City earlier in the window.  <br>
</p>
<p>
'Griezmann is a player that has a market, with clubs interested, and we are building the squad searching for a financial equilibrium,' president Joan Laporta said, as cited by Mundo Deportivo. <br>
</p>
<p>
'With Antoine, we don't have any problem, we love him. But if the market moves, we are open to all offers because we are in a delicate moment where we have to balance financial fair play and because of that, we should speak with all the players so that it does not hurt them, or (if it does) for the least time possible.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We are making these balances and are open to all the options that the market can give us, but we don't want to harm the team competitively.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Although he remains a first-team player and will be heavily relied upon by Ronald Koeman with Lionel Messi no longer at the club, it hasn't stopped the Catalans looking to cash in on him this summer. <br>
</p>
<p>
Juventus, City and Chelsea have all been linked in to the forward but it was a sensational return to the Wanda Metropolitano that grabbed headlines. <br>
</p>
<p>
Barcelona proposed a swap deal for midfielder Saul Niguez which would see Griezmann return to the Spanish capital. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Blaugrana also reportedly attempted a swap deal with City naming Riyad Mahrez, Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva or Aymeric Laporte as the four players they would be interested in.  <br>

<p>
The summer transfer window is alive and kicking as clubs throughout Europe look to cement their squads ahead of next season.<br>
</p>
<p>
The future of England captain Harry Kane is set to be major talking point throughout the window, though the Tottenham forward has now returned to the club. <br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the bombshell that Lionel Messi has left Barcelona for PSG will certainly have a drastic impact on the transfer market. <br>
</p>
<p>
It's the Manchester clubs who have made the biggest splash so far, with United signing Jadon Sancho for £73m and City's £100m acquisition of Jack Grealish shattering the British transfer record.    <br>
