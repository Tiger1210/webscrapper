<h2>
Danny Mills is broadcast saying 'basically, United are s***', LIVE on Sky Sports, with ex-Leeds and Man City star airing his REAL views on Old Trafford crisis while show was meant to be on an ad break</h2>
<ul><li><b>
Danny Mills and Sol Bamba were discussing Manchester United on Sky Sports</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
When the they thought coverage had gone to an advert break, Mills spoke freely</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The former Leeds and Man City player said: 'Basically, United are s***!'</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
United were hammered 5-0 at home by fierce rivals Liverpool on Sunday</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Danny Mills has delivered one of the all-time great sporting TV gaffes, offering his unfiltered verdict on Manchester United's woes when he thought the cameras had stopped rolling.<br>
</p>
<p>
The former Manchester City and Leeds player quipped: 'Basically, United are s***!', when presenter Peter Graves indicated Sky Sports' coverage was paused for an advert break.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sinking back in his chair, Graves, who had been discussing with Mills and Sol Bamba United's ongoing issues and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's precarious position as manager, said: 'Great chat lads, well done, that was really interesting.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mills was appearing on the broadcast along with Bamba and both men were pictured either side of Graves on video link.<br>
</p>
<p>
With his head down and earphones in, Mills responded to the presenter's congratulations for the interesting conversation with his simple assessment that United 'are s***'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Both Bamba and Graves laughed at the comment and then Mills shrugged his shoulders, saying: 'But they are.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Fast-thinking viewers watching from home took to social media with a recording of the clip.<br>
</p>
<p>
One wrote: 'Just watching The Football Show on Sky Sports, wasn't expecting a simple, honest appraisal of Man United from Danny Mills.'<br>
</p>
<p>
United have been the talk of football since their 5-0 demolition at the hands of fierce rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford.<br>
</p>
<p>
Many have been calling for Solskjaer to be sacked, but the manager is going to be given a chance to turn things around.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mills and Bamba had been reflecting eloquently on the situation at the club before what they, and Graves, thought was a break in the live coverage.<br>
</p>
<p>
The contrast in Mills' succinct verdict when he thought he was able to speak freely made the howler even more entertaining.<br>
</p>
<p>
It seems the error came on the Sky Sports Premier League channel where coverage had continued, while on Sky Sports News the advert break was in progress.<br>
</p>
<p>
The broadcaster issued an apology upon returning from the adverts.<br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer is under massive pressure to beat Tottenham on Saturday but has the backing of Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold for now.<br>
</p>
<p>
He was even given a morale-boosting training ground visit by his former mentor Sir Alex Ferguson but will be under no illusions that drastically improved performances are needed.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mauricio Pochettino is reportedly still the preferred option to come in if the club decide to sack Solskjaer, but he is under contract at PSG.<br>
</p>
<p>
Antonio Conte is also a high-quality option and has the benefit of being unattached at the moment.<br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer could also have dressing room fires to extinguish with Paul Pogba, who was sent off just minutes after coming on against Liverpool, understood to have apologised to team-mates but not his boss.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pogba later described those claims as 'big lies to make headlines'.<br>

<h2>
Cristiano Ronaldo is 'holding the dressing room TOGETHER at Man United and is urging team-mates not to down tools' as he rallies behind under-fire boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/14/49700273-0-image-a-90_1635339845336.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
Man United are in disarray after being thumped 5-0 by Liverpool on Sunday</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Reports of growing discontent among the dressing room continue to emerge</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly urged players to support Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Beleaguered Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has the support of his highest-profile player in Cristiano Ronaldo, with the Portuguese superstar encouraging his team-mates to get behind the Norwegian.<br>
</p>
<p>
According to the Manchester Evening News, Ronaldo is 'holding the dressing room together' at Old Trafford as the club continues to reel from their chastening 5-0 home thrashing by arch rivals Liverpool on Sunday.<br>
</p>
<p>
The report adds that Ronaldo is urging players 'to not down tools' and to maintain standards - despite some being irked by Solskjaer's tactics and personnel choices.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Red Devils are in turmoil at present, having conceded nine goals in their last two Premier League matches - a 4-2 defeat at Leicester City preceded the humiliation at the hands of Liverpool.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ronaldo knows Solskjaer well, having played alongside him during his first spell at the club before being bought by the under-fire manager over the summer in a 19.7million deal from Juventus.<br>
</p>
<p>
Despite Ronaldo's rallying cry, pressure is mounting on Solskjaer as the club fail to meet expectations under his watch.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Times reports that a clear-the-air meeting between players and management occurred just two days after losing at Leicester - with players not holding back on their opinions.<br>
</p>
<p>
One aspect that had irked a member of the squad was the elevation of Maguire to captain just six months after joining the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
The England centre back was signed in an 80million deal from Leicester in August 2019 but by January 2020 he was handed the armband on a permanent basis.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 28-year-old was picked ahead of the likes of David de Gea and Marcus Rashford, who were longer-serving members at Old Trafford and had both been skipper at times during that 2019-20 season.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Maguire captaincy situation wasn't the only issue discussed during the meeting, with another player criticising some of his team-mates for an apparent lack of motivation in training.<br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer's tactics and favouritism were also lambasted, as another member of the squad asked him why he is so against changing a losing team - especially when others are performing well in training.<br>
</p>
<p>
As reported by Sportsmail, despite the mounting pressure,Solskjaer is set for a stay of execution as manager but is still fearing for his long-term future at the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer took training at Carrington on Tuesday for the first time since United's 5-0 thrashing by Liverpool,a display labelled 'embarrassing' by senior players.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Norwegian is preparing the team for Saturday's trip to Tottenham amid a backdrop of intense scrutiny and some members of his squad questioning whether the slide can be halted under his management.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail understandsthat United - who gave Solskjaer a new three-year contract over the summer - were planning to review the 48-year-old's position in December.<br>
</p>
<p>
The galling surrender at Old Trafford last weekend has, however, accelerated that process. Board-level talks between co-chairman Joel Glazer, Ed Woodward and managing director Richard Arnold took place on Monday.<br>
</p>
<p>
United had not been prepared for such a dire run of results, with Solskjaer's side losing five of their last nine games.<br>
</p>
<p>
The board has so far resisted the calls for change, with the manager expected to remain in charge at Spurs. Sir Alex Ferguson and former chairman Martin Edwards visited Carrington on Tuesday afternoon, with United insisting the pair were attending a pre-planned commitment.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ferguson has been a champion of his former striker and there has always been reticence to change at the top when United have fallen on troubling spells of form in previous campaigns.<br>
</p>
<p>
Yet Solskjaer now faces three huge games - first Tottenham, next a Champions League clash at Atalanta and then the derby against Pep Guardiolas Manchester City - that look likely to determine his prospects.<br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer is currently in the middle of a rare full week on the training ground in an attempt to arrest the slump in form.<br>
</p>
<p>
Some players have privately raised concern over the tempo of sessions and believe they are being consistently outsmarted tactically by opponents.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Glazers, based in Florida, have been watching developments with interest but senior United sources were adamant last night that no approaches for potential successors had been made after Antonio Conte, the former Chelsea boss, expressed an interest in a move.<br>
</p>
<p>
Although formerly of Liverpool, Leicester Citys Brendan Rodgers has admirers at United - along with Ajaxs Erik ten Hag.<br>

<h2>
One unnamed Manchester United star 'is questioning Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's call to make Harry Maguire captain six months after joining', as more reports of dressing room disharmony emerge</h2>

<ul><li><b>
Manchester United's fallout from losing to Leicester and Liverpool continues</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Harry Maguire's appointment as United captain has been reportedly questioned</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Maguire was named skipper just six months after signing from Leicester</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
But a dressing-room inquest led this decision to be questioned by a player</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
The discontent at Manchester United continues with under-fire manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reportedly questioned by one first-team player over why he appointed Harry Maguire as captain of the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Red Devils are going through turmoil at present, having conceded nine goals in their last two Premier League matches - a 4-2 defeat at Leicester City on October 16 that was followed up by a humiliating 5-0 home loss to bitter rivals Liverpool on Sunday.<br>
</p>
<p>
And according to a report, a clear-the-air meeting between players and management occurred just two days after the former result - with players not holding back on their opinions.<br>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
'He's [Maguire] come in and been a leader in the group. I've been, not surprised, but I've been impressed by his leadership skills, so Harry will keep on wearing the armband,' Solskjaer said at the time.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He's come in and everything about him tells me he is a leader. He's part of a group that we've had, that have been leading this young group.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Ashley [Young] has been of course, Marcus is a young lad, but also David, Harry. So Harry will keep on wearing the armband now.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The Maguire captaincy situation wasn't the only issue discussed though during the meeting.<br>

<ul><li><b>
Ex-England footballer Kieron Dyer has been taken into hospital to undergo tests</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
He recently sustained a collapsed lung during an appearance on Celebrity SAS</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Dyer also suffered a fractured rib and hypothermia and took months to recover</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
He said only way to cope with the pain was to pump himself with paracetamol</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Former Newcastle and England footballer Kieron Dyer has been taken into hospital for tests - months after suffering a collapsed lung on TV show Celebrity SAS.<br>
</p>
<p>
Dyer, who is now the under-23s manager at Ipswich Town, also suffered hypothermia and a fractured rib during his appearance on the hit Channel 4 show.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ipswich released a statement on Wednesday asking for 'privacy' for Dyer and have not said whether his latest problems are related to his time on the show.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The Club can confirm that Town U23 manager Kieron Dyer is currently undertaking tests in hospital,' the statement read.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Everyone at Ipswich Town Football Club sends their best wishes to Kieron at this time.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We ask everyone to respect Kieron's privacy, and we will be making no further comment on the matter.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Dyer's appearance on the 2021 series of SAS: Who Dares Wins was beset by problems, and he took months to recover from his medical issues.<br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking afterwards, Dyer said: 'There were quite a few things to overcome.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I'd had hypothermia, and I had a fractured rib, a collapsed lung, and one of my testicles was as big as an apple.<br>
</p>
<p>
'When I had my first hospital visit my lung wasn't picked up. I was about to fly but I didn't feel quite right and went to hospital again and they spotted it.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It was lucky I didn't get on the plane.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Dyer revealed that he had to use painkillers to cope with his injuries. He said:'I had to mask the pain and pump myself full of paracetamol.'<br>
</p>
<p>
During the show, Dyer also revealed the emotional toll of being sexually abused when he was just '11 or 12' years old.<br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Ant Middleton and Mark 'Billy' Billingham, the former England footballer said that theabuse he sustained by his uncle 'turned him into a monster'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Dyer  whose cracked rib forced him out of the competition  said: 'I didn't want to go on about sob stories or accomplishments, I wanted you to judge me from a clean slate, and yeah, I was a victim of sexual abuse when I was a kid.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I was 11 or 12 from a family member and this monster, well this f**king p**k turned me into a monster, and for the rest of my life the amount of people I've hurt because of these personality traits.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Like family, dad, mum, wife, you can go on and on. I always had the mindset of do you know what, 'cause I'm a victim, this is the way I am.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I have just learned today when I come out of here, I'm not a victim of sexual abuse no more, because every time I'm a victim, he wins. Every time I hurt my family and they're victims, he wins. I'm not a victim no more.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Dyer was also present during the recent Newcastle and Tottenham game that saw a supporter receivemedical treatment in the stands.<br>
</p>
<p>
Discussing the importance of having equipment like defibrillators at football stadiums, the ex-Newcastle playersaid at the time: 'When you do your coaching badges, it's compulsory that you do your first-aid.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Just having that bit of knowledge can help save people's lives.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The former midfielder retired from playing football at the age of 34 after an injury-hit career. Hecame through the ranks at Ipswich and made 117 appearances during two spells at the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
In 1996 he moved to Newcastle for 6.5million. During his time at the clubhe scored 36 goals in 251 appearances andwent to the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. Following that he playedfor West Ham, QPR and Middlesbrough.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, he decided to end his 17-year career as a player and move into coaching after being released by Middlesbrough.<br>
</p>
<p>
Dyer subsequently tookup an academy coaching role at his first club Ipswich Townin 2014.<br>
</p>
<p>
He was then promoted to assistant manager of the U18 side in 2018 before taking charge of the U23 team last October.<br>

<h2>
FOUR derby defeats, TEN goals conceded and just ONE scored against rivals across the capital so far this season... the dark clouds are building over Nuno Espirito Santo after Tottenham's latest London slump</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/13/49699091-0-image-a-71_1635337291745.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
Tottenham suffered another derby loss as they were beaten 1-0 by West Ham</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Spurs have now lost to four London rivals, conceding a total of 10 goals</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The team are toothless and lack invention under boss Nuno Espirito Santo</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
He is struggling to get performances out of his stars, who look uninspired</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Most Tottenham managers are given the same piece of advice when they first take control in north London. Whatever you do, make sure you beat Arsenal. If you can't win against Arsenal, make sure you beat Chelsea. And do not - under any circumstances - lose to West Ham.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nuno Espirito Santo will have understood the importance of derbies when he was appointed, and - throwing in a 3-0 defeat by Crystal Palace - he has now committed the cardinal sin of losing four of them and conceding 10 goals in the process.<br>
</p>
<p>
His Spurs side were ousted by another London rival on Sunday as Michail Antonio pounced to seal a 1-0 win for the Hammers, and just like every contest in the capital this season, it was another toothless display from Nuno's men.<br>
</p>
<p>
Slow tempo, lack of invention and a non-existent goal threat. Nuno's men had a couple of half chances in the first half through Son Heung-min and Harry Kane, but in the second half they failed to record a single shot.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Portuguese coach was never a popular choice with fans, and was always going to be reliant on picking up results fast. After a 'honeymoon' period of three straight wins to kick off the season, things have spiraled quickly, with many supporters questioning the style he is trying to implement.<br>
</p>
<p>
There was no recognisable game plan or strategy on show at the London Stadium, and Nuno even had the audacity to claim Spurs were the better team.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We were the better team, honestly,' he said after the game. 'I think we controlled the game, we had chances. We had possession. West Ham are a good team but they only created chances on counter-attacks and set-pieces. We played better, but this is football.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The last pass was there but we need to be more aggressive in our offensive game. We controlled the game. The whole game was under control.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, having the lion's share of possession doesn't win you football matches if there is no end product, and there was nothing about this game from Tottenham's point of view that suggested 'control'.<br>
</p>
<p>
#NunoOut trended yet again on Twitter after the loss to West Ham, and even if the players do still believe in his methods, it's clear to see that many fans have lost what little faith they had. In the boardroom, patience must be wearing thin too.<br>
</p>
<p>
Spurs were put to the sword in the last three London derbies, conceding nine goals in the process and scoring just one - a consolation against Arsenal. This was a different equation entirely. A close game that was there for the taking and instead of grabbing it by the scruff of the neck, Tottenham were pedestrian.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nuno would no doubt say he needs more time to hammer home his philosophies. He would say that if you look at the Premier League table, his team are still in touching distance of the top four, sitting sixth and just two points off fourth with five victories - including one against Manchester City. But the stats do not flatter his side in the slightest.<br>
</p>
<p>
Spurs have just nine Premier League goals - with Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and even struggling Watford and Newcastle netting more.<br>
</p>
<p>
For expected goals, they rank 17th with 9.7, figures by Opta show, just above relegation favourites Burnley and Norwich. They are second bottom - again ahead of the Canaries - when it comes to shooting, registering a measly 94 shots. In comparison, Liverpool are at the top of the shooting charts with 185.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tottenham's lack of penetration is summed up by their lowly standing when it comes to touches in the opposition box - ranking 17th again with just 181. And the lack of aggression and intensity we have seen from Nuno's side has resulted in Spurs winning possession back just 33 times in the final third.<br>
</p>
<p>
Fans want to see a Tottenham side that attacks and plays with flair - they haven't witnessed that since Mauricio Pochettino was in charge. If pragmatism brings results, that can be forgiven, but there have been too many poor displays since the former Wolves boss took charge.<br>
</p>
<p>
Going forward, Nuno has more dark clouds than silver linings.<br>
</p>
<p>
He is not getting performances out of his top stars. Having battled to keep hold of Harry Kane, the England skipper now looks bereft of confidence with just one Premier League goal and is not playing like someone who believes in the manager's blueprint.<br>
</p>
<p>
Whatever style he is trying to introduce, it does not allow his midfielders to be creative, despite possessing a handful of players who are gifted technically. The likes of Tanguy Ndombele, Giovani Lo Celso and Dele Alli all look stifled, while Son has been chipping away with goals without much regular service.<br>
</p>
<p>
Spurs are still in every cup competition and face a trip to Burnley next, before a huge clash at home to fellow strugglers Manchester United. It's a defining week.<br>
</p>
<p>
Crashing out of the Carabao Cup and allowing a wounded Red Devils side to rediscover their confidence at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium would be damaging - perhaps too damaging for Nuno to recover from.<br>
</p>
<p>
His number one priority is to sharpen his blunt tools. Too often Spurs have let games pass them by and are not nearly creative enough. Whether that's something to be worked on in training or tinkered with in his tactics, the team will be lucky to finish in the top seven playing this way.<br>
</p>
<p>
When Nuno was appointed, he promised to follow the club's 'DNA' and make the fans 'enjoy watching' the team.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Having a squad like Tottenham's, you can only have one DNA, you can only think one way,' he said. 'We have to enjoy the game, we have to play the game. When you have a squad of quality, talented players like we have, the DNA is to make the fans proud, make them enjoy watching.<br>
</p>
<p>
'This is our DNA, to make our fans proud of us. There is no question about it that that will happen. We're going to make them proud and they're going to enjoy the team, for sure.'<br>
</p>
<p>
It was a bold promise, and so far an empty one. For any supporter, there is very little to be proud of as things stand.<br>

<h2>
Harry Kane 'has the hump' and is failing to 'lead by example' at Tottenham, insists Teddy Sheringham... as he urges England captain to put failed Man City move behind him and 'do better'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/25/11/49606267-0-image-a-7_1635156838061.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
Harry Kane was desperate to leave Tottenham in the summer transfer window</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Manchester City were linked with a 150m move for the 28-year-old striker</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
But the England captain was forced to accept defeat in trying to leave Spurs</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Teddy Sheringham believes Kane now 'has the hump' because of failed move</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Tottenham striker Harry Kane is playing like someone who has the hump and who has shirked his leadership responsibilities, according to Teddy Sheringham.<br>
</p>
<p>
The England captain was desperate to leave the north London side in the summer, with Premier League champions Manchester City heavily linked with a 150million move.<br>
</p>
<p>
But the 28-year-old was forced to admit defeat in his hopes of securing a move away to a Champions League outfit and ended up staying at Nuno Espirito Santo's men.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane however has made a modest start to the new season, scoring just once in eight Premier League games and just seven in 12 across all competitions.<br>
</p>
<p>
And Sheringham - who scored 98 goals for Spurs in nearly 200 appearances - insists Kane is showing the frustration of failing to get his move on the pitch, but urged him to put that disappointment aside and 'do better'.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He was probably given assurances that he could leave,' Sheringham said via The Evening Standard.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Those assurances haven't been stuck to and it looks like Kane has the hump.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He needs to change that around and realise he is still the Tottenham vice-captain and still a Tottenham player and do better.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think it's a really tough time for Tottenham. When you have a striker who is also the vice-captain like Harry Kane, he leads by example rather than telling everyone what to do.<br>
</p>
<p>
'That's a very different scenario. They need a leader at the back or in midfield to dominate and dictate and tell people what they're doing wrong.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I'm really not a lover of a centre-forward being the captain and he's not performing at the best of his capabilities at the moment, so he's not even leading by example.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane is expected to captain his club against fellow Premier League side Burnley in their fourth-round Carabao Cup clash at Turf Moor on Wednesday night.<br>
</p>
<p>
The striker is part of a full-strength squad Nuno Espirito Santo is expected to takeas Spurs aim to reach the quarter-finals of the competition.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Portuguese left the big guns at home last week, and the decision backfired as they suffered a shock Europa Conference League defeat by Vitesse Arnhem, three days before their reverse at West Ham in the Premier League.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Basically yes, but we have players that we need, players that are working hard, maybe with the expectation that they will have more minutes, the expectation that they deserve more minutes,' Nuno said when asked whether his Premier League squad would travel.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But it's up to us to manage all these situations individually, at the same time looking at which are the best partnerships for what we want to be as a team.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane has scored in the Carabao Cup already this term, netting in the initial 2-2 draw at Wolves before Spurs won the third-round clash on penalties.<br>

Sir Alex Ferguson reveals the ability to communicate with his stars was one of the biggest lessons he learned in management... as Man United legend remains behind ex-protege Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/15/49703439-0-image-a-55_1635344653654.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
At Manchester United, legendary former boss Sir Alex Ferguson won 13 league titles and the Champions League twice in his trophy-laden reign</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Ferguson has now said communicating with stars is the best lesson he learned</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The iconic tactician, 79, remains influential behind the scenes at Old Trafford</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
He has been supportive of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer despite United's form this year</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Manchester United great Sir Alex Ferguson says the ability to communicate effectively with the entire dressing room is one of the biggest lessons he learned in management.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 79-year-old retired as Premier League champion in 2013, bringing down the curtain on an incredible stint with the Red Devils that included 13 league titles and two Champions League crowns.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ferguson, who was at Old Trafford as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side lost 5-0 to Liverpool on Sunday, has been sharing some of his knowledge as part of UEFA's recent Pro Licence student exchange programme.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I really have a great affection for people who are learning the game and want to be coaches and managers,' the former United boss told the UEFA website.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I started (managing) at 32 years of age and, of course, in the time from there on you do learn.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But I honestly would say that going into management at 32, there were a couple of things that I knew that were useful: one, I could make a decision; two, I played the game; and three, I had my coaching (qualifications). Now, these things are really important.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Other things I developed by the learning process if you give it time, particularly communication. I think when you're in charge of a football team, you're not just in charge of 11 players on the pitch.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Ferguson was speaking to a current group of Pro Licence students studying with the national associations of Bulgaria, Cyprus, Poland and the Republic of Ireland, including former United defender John O'Shea.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think that it's really important that coaches go through all the courses they can,' Ferguson added. 'Even the refresher courses and keep attending them, because there's always something, little bits, you learn all the way down.<br>
</p>
<p>
'UEFA has to lead the way in terms of the directions of coaches and the avenues they can afford and offer them to improve themselves as coaches.<br>
</p>
<p>
'And I think it'll always be UEFA that is the most important organisation in terms of creating the right platforms for young people to do well.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Ferguson has remained a key influence behind the scenes at United, and reportedly has thrown his backing behind the under-pressure Solskjaer in the wake of the mauling at the hands of the club's fierce rivals.<br>
</p>
<p>
The legendary Scot and former chairman Martin Edwards visited Carrington yesterday, but United insisted that both were attending a pre-planned commitment.<br>
</p>
<p>
Having mentored Solskjaer during his early days in coaching, Ferguson remains a champion of the iconic ex-striker despite United's torrid form this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail has previously reported that United - who handed Solskjaer a new three-year contract over the summer - were planning to review his position in December.<br>
</p>
<p>
The limp defeat against Liverpool accelerated the process, however, with board-level talks held between Joel Glazer, Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold on Monday.<br>
</p>
<p>
United were not anticipating such a nosedive in fortunes, with Solskjaer's side having collapsed to five losses in their last nine games across all competitions.<br>
</p>
<p>
The club have been touted to sack Solskjaer soon, and have been heavily linked with former Chelsea and Inter Milan boss Antonio Conte - who is keen on the job.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Mauricio Pochettino remains United's first-choice target, the Daily Star claim, and the current PSG manager is said to be highly rated by Ferguson, too.<br>

Kepa Arrizabalaga insists he 'will be ready' to take over No 1 shirt when Edouard Mendy jets off to AFCON next year following Spaniard's shootout heroics in Carabao Cup</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/14/49701753-0-image-a-76_1635341831160.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
Kepa Arrizabalaga starred for Chelsea in shootout win over Southampton</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Spaniard has had to make do with games in cup matches as No 2 stopper</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Edouard Mendy is No 1 but is set to leave for African Cup of Nations next year</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Arrizabalaga is ready to step in and stake a claim for the No 1 jersey again</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Kepa Arrizabalaga has insisted he 'will be ready' for Chelsea in January when Edouard Mendy is likely to be away at the Africa Cup of Nations following more shoot-out heroics on Tuesday.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Spaniard got the faintest of touches to save Theo Walcott's penalty while Will Smallbone blazed over for Southampton to give the Blues a 4-3 spot-kick victory in the Carabao Cup last-16 tie.<br>
</p>
<p>
It was a similar story in the previous round against Aston Villa and means Thomas Tuchel's side are into the quarter-finals of the competition for the first time since they lost the 2019 final to Manchester City.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kepa made only his fourth appearance of the campaign in the win over Southampton but it was the third time he had helped the club to penalty shoot-out success this season and he could be more regularly called upon in January when first-choice Mendy is set to be away for up to four weeks with Senegal at the AFCON.<br>
</p>
<p>
But the 72million goalkeeper insisted: 'Well, it's two months away. Of course we know it can happen and I will be ready but we have a lot of games until we start thinking about that.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Let's go step by step and we'll see what happens. If he goes to the African Cup, all the best and I'll be ready. But it's still a long way to arrive at that point.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Chances continue to be few and far between for the Spain international but he recovered well after some sloppiness for Southampton's equaliser where he only partially saved Kyle Walker-Peters' effort with his legs and Che Adams was on hand to tap home.<br>
</p>
<p>
That goal cancelled out Kai Havertz 44th-minute opener which had Chelsea on course for another routine win, having thrashed Norwich 7-0 on Saturday, but the visitors hit back and Kepa denied Adam Armstrong, Smallbone, Lyanco and Mohammed Salisu after the break to send the tie to spot-kicks.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I've always said I try to help the team in the best way but I do feel really good at penalties,' admitted Kepa, who also inspired shoot-out success over Villarreal in the UEFA Super Cup final back in August.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I feel confident. It's a bit of luck, a bit of work, a bit of everything but I feel really good.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Of course I want to play more regularly. My last game was also a cup game, more or less a month ago, so it's not easy to sometimes step in and feel the same as you would if you play every week.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But I try to be ready, train hard, be involved in the team. Also, I feel the confidence of the manager - this is really important. I've felt his support from the beginning and I think when I step in I'm ready to help the team. I'm happy to do that.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Kepa's next opportunity is likely to be the Carabao Cup quarter-final in December before potentially more minutes in January, which the Spanish ace will hope includes a two-legged last-four clash in a competition Chelsea have not won since 2015.<br>
</p>
<p>
'December and January here is so busy, a lot of games but we have the squad with big quality to play every game with a strong team,' he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We're ready to arrive to a final. Let's go step by step, but of course that's in our mind.'<br>

<h2>
Borussia Dortmund 'put a huge 101m price tag on Jude Bellingham as they look to fend off interest from Liverpool'... and he's the 'No 1 target' for Jurgen Klopp, in a move which would smash Reds' transfer record</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/13/49698543-0-image-m-22_1635336736960.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
Jude Bellingham is reportedly valued at 101million by Borussia Dortmund</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The 18-year-old has cemented his spot as one of the world's finest youngsters</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Liverpool are said to be interested in signing him, but the price may be an issue</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
It has been reported that starlet Bellingham is Jurgen Klopp's No 1 priority target</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Borussia Dortmund have reportedly landed starlet Jude Bellingham with a hefty 101million price tag as they look to fend off interest from Liverpool.<br>
</p>
<p>
Bellingham has quickly cemented his spot as one of the world's most exciting talents during his time in Germany, and is coveted by a number of elite clubs.<br>
</p>
<p>
Among them are believed to be the Anfield outfit, but their hopes of landing the 18-year-old have been rocked by his exorbitant fee, Bild have claimed.<br>
</p>
<p>
So far this season Bellingham has started each of Dortmund's fixtures in both the Bundesliga and Champions League, and continues to catch the eye.<br>
</p>
<p>
It has been previously reported by a number of publications that Jurgen Klopp was keen on luring him to Merseyside, but he would have to break his club's transfer record.<br>
</p>
<p>
Bellingham moved to Dortmund from his boyhood club, Birmingham, for 25m in 2020, but his valuation has now sensationally quadrupled because of his displays.<br>
</p>
<p>
There appears to be little hope of his current club backing down, either, with Bild going on to add that they will not let him leave for anything under the 101m fee.<br>
</p>
<p>
As it stands, Bellingham is committed to Dortmund until 2025 - and, provided a club doesn't splash out over the 100m milestone, he looks set to stay until then.<br>
</p>
<p>
In the wake of several eye-catching performances this term, it is likely Bellingham will be happy to stay put. He has made over 60 appearances for Dortmund so far.<br>
</p>
<p>
Having settled quickly into an elite level, Bellingham was also rewarded with eight caps for his country, and will be an integral player under England boss Gareth Southgate, who is bedding him in slowly to manage expectations and the player's growing body.<br>
</p>
<p>
At the weekend Bellingham netted a jaw-dropping solo goal against Arminia Bielefeld, taking his tally for the league campaign to two, with two assists.<br>
</p>
<p>
Showcasing his quick feet and trickery, the midfielder weaved his way beyond a handful of defenders to break into the box, and then chipped over the goalkeeper.<br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Dortmund are reportedly lining up a move for Bellingham's younger brother, Jobe, also from Birmingham - with the 16-year-old a long-term target.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Sun have reported that interest is growing at theWestfalenstadion to reunite the two siblings, and Jobe has been making a name for himself in the Midlands.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jobe almost broke his brother's record of becoming the club's youngest ever player earlier this season, but was twice an unused substitute in EFL Cup fixtures.<br>
</p>
<p>
He is yet to make his first appearance for Lee Bowyer's side, but Dortmund are believed to have held an interest in him since he was aged just 14.<br>
</p>
<p>
Both brothers are represented by their father, Mark, and the report goes on to say that the family are keen for Jobe to stay in Birmingham for the time being.<br>

West Ham are granted planning permission to increase their capacity at the London Stadium to 62,500... a move set to make the venue the largest club ground in the capital, ahead of Arsenal and Tottenham</h2>

<ul><li><b>
West Ham have been given permission to increase the London Stadium capacity</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The former Olympic Stadium will have 2,500 seats added in, taking it to 62,500</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
After the work, the ground will officially become London's largest club stadium</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Both the Emirates and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will be overtaken by the club</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
West Ham have been granted planning permission to increase the London Stadium capacity to 62,500.<br>
</p>
<p>
An extra 2,500 seats will be added once the club are given the all-clear, taking the former Olympic Stadium above the Emirates Stadium and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as the biggest club ground in the capital.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The application to increase the matchday capacity will give an even greater number of our fans the opportunity to watch our exciting team in action in person,' West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Since the regular return of supporters this year, we have seen a terrific response with every Premier League fixture so far this season sold out, and we thank them for their continued fantastic backing including breaking attendance records as part of regular capacity crowds at London Stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
'This is another great sign of progression during a hugely positive time for the club.'<br>
</p>
<p>
West Ham moved from Upton Park in 2016 to the showpiece venue from the 2012 Olympics.<br>
</p>
<p>
After some initial teething problems the stadium now plays host to David Moyes' side in European action as well as domestic competitions.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Everyone here is doing everything we can to grow and develop this football club, on and off the pitch, for the benefit of our supporters, and we all feel that things are moving in the right direction,' Moyes said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The supporters being back has been fantastic and the atmosphere they have created, with 60,000 in the stadium, has been right up there every game.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Having more fans in here cheering the team on will make it even better for us all and we are really looking forward to welcoming more of our young supporters and families to London Stadium.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The long-term plans are to increase capacity as high as 67,000 in the coming years.<br>

Mauricio Pochettino 'is still Manchester United's No 1 choice' if they sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, with the Paris Saint-Germain boss 'highly rated' by club legend Sir Alex Ferguson</h2>

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is under pressure after Sunday's 5-0 loss to Liverpool</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Manchester United will keep the struggling Norwegian boss for now</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Mauricio Pochettino has been linked to United several times in recent years</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The Paris Saint-Germain manager is reportedly 'still United's top choice'</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Pochettino is highly rated by United's legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Mauricio Pochettino is 'still Manchester United's No 1 choice' to take the manager's position should they eventually sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.<br>
</p>
<p>
The United manager has never been under more pressure following their humiliating 5-0 defeat byLiverpool on Sunday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pochettino has been linked with the job in the past but has been managing Paris Saint-Germain since January.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Daily Star claim that United still consider Pochettino their top choice, despite the fact he is already in one of Europe's biggest jobs.<br>
</p>
<p>
It's said that United originally wanted Solskjaer to 'bridge to the gap' between Jose Mourinho and Pochettino at Old Trafford.<br>
</p>
<p>
That was until United's memorable win over PSG in the Champions League in 2019 helped earn the interim boss the job permanently.<br>
</p>
<p>
The United boss will be given more time despite Sunday's embarrassing defeat, and the Daily Star claim that this will give them more chance to gauge the availability of Pochettino - someone who is highly rated by Sir Alex Ferguson.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmailpreviously reported that United  who gave Solskjaer a new three-year contract over the summer  were planning to review the 48-year-old's position in December.<br>
</p>
<p>
The galling surrender at Old Trafford has, however, accelerated that process. Talks between co-chairman Joel Glazer, Ed Woodward and managing director Richard Arnold took place on Monday.<br>
</p>
<p>
United had not been prepared for such a dire run of results, with Solskjaer's side losing five of their last nine games.<br>
</p>
<p>
The club's board has so far resisted the calls for change, with the Norwegian expected to remain in charge at Spurs. Ferguson and former chairman Martin Edwards visited Carrington on Tuesday afternoon, with United insisting the pair were attending a pre-planned commitment.<br>
</p>
<p>
Yet Solskjaer now faces three huge games  Tottenham, a Champions League clash at Atalanta and then the derby against Pep Guardiola's Manchester City  that look likely to determine his prospects.<br>
</p>
<p>
Some players have privately raised concerns over the tempo of sessions and believe they are being consistently outsmarted tactically by opponents.<br>
</p>
<p>
Glazer, based in Florida, has been watching developments with interest but senior United sources were adamant last night that no approaches for potential successors had been made after Antonio Conte, the former Chelsea boss, expressed an interest in a move.<br>
</p>
<p>
Former Liverpool and current Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers, along with Ajax's Erik ten Hag have also been linked to the role should it become available.<br>

Paul Pogba was sent off during Man United's 5-0 loss to Liverpool last week</b>

</li><br>
<li><b>
Pogba reportedly apologised to his team-mates but said nothing to his manager</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The star has denied those claims, describing them as 'big lies to make headlines'</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is under big pressure after the devastating Liverpool loss</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Pogba's contract expires at the end of this season and his future is still in doubt</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Paul Pogbahas denied claims he snubbed under-fire Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after being left out of the the starting line-up in their humiliating 5-0 loss to Liverpool.<br>
</p>
<p>
The French midfielder did not start the derby clash after being dropped by United's Norwegian boss on Sunday and while he did come on at half-time, he was sent off 15 minutes into the second half for a high lunge on Liverpool's Naby Keita.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Red Devils are still feeling the impact of the devastating defeat by their fiercest rivals, with Solskjaer's position as manager under threat - though United will keep the Norwegian in the role for now.<br>
</p>
<p>
According to The Sun, Pogba apologised to his team-mates for his red card at Old Trafford, though did not say anything to Solskjaer after the loss.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pogba hit back at those claims on Wednesday, taking to Twitter to post a screenshot of the report with a 'fake news' stamp over the top of it. He captioned the image: 'Big lies to make headlines'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The reported snub had raised questions over Pogba's future at Old Trafford, with the 28-year-old's contract at Manchester United expiring at the end of this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pogba's agent Mino Raiola has insisted that there is 'no update' in regards to the midfielder's ongoing contract situation.<br>
</p>
<p>
If Pogba fails to agree to an extension before January, he will be allowed to discuss terms and sign a pre-contract with a foreign club ahead of a move next summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pogba has been linked with moves to Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain, while United are keen to keep the midfielder.<br>
</p>
<p>
When asked about talks over a new deal, Raiola told The Times: 'You would have to ask Manchester United about it.<br>
</p>
<p>
'At this moment everything is calm. There is no update.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, club legend PaulScholes said he wouldn't be upset if the Liverpool disappointment was Pogba's last outing for the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
He told Premier League Productions: 'To say a disappointing day would be a complete understatement.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think we all realise it's been difficult, I just think the manager got caught up in the emotion of the comeback [against Atalanta in the Champions League] on Wednesday night.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We keep going back to that game but you were never going to do that against Liverpool, they have too much quality.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I don't think it was a lack of effort, I think tactically they were set up in a way where this could happen and unfortunately it did happen.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Paul Pogba coming on to the pitch at half-time to try and help the team and maybe get a little respectability about it, tries to stand on the ball, tries to show how strong he is in the middle of the pitch gives the goal away.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Then later on gets sent off with a ridiculous tackle. Now you're 5-0 down with 10 men. You'd have to think, if Ole's still a manager there, will we see Pogba again in a United shirt?<br>
</p>
<p>
'He's caused mayhem over the last couple of years.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Everyone knows what a talent he is, everybody trusts him, every manager trusts him, tried to give him his head and let him be the player he's been.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But with all the commotion, not signing his contract, almost holding the club to ransom, and then he comes on and does something like that.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's not Ole's fault, don't get me wrong, but that's part of it which almost summed the United performance up today.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Look, he probably will play [again] won't he? But I don't think they will be missing anything if he doesn't.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He's had numerous chances, he keeps saying he lacks consistency, but that is just [a lack of] discipline and disrespect for your manager and your team-mates, what he's done.'<br>

<ul><li><b>
Fernando Llorente has been a free agent since Udinese released him in August</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The 36-year-old is set to join Eibar on a short-term deal until the end of the term</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Eibar sit second in the Segunda Division, just one point off table-toppers Almeria</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Fernando Llorente is back in football after agreeing to join Spanish second division side Eibar on a free transfer.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 36-year-old had been without a club following his release from Italian outfit Udinese in August.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, the striker underwent a medical at Eibar on Wednesday and is now set to sign for them until the end of the season.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Eibar has reached an agreement in principle with Fernando Llorente for the incorporation of the Riojan striker until the end of the season, at the expense of passing the medical examination,' the club said in a short statement.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The player is currently undergoing various medical tests at IMQ, the official Medical Insurer of the gunsmith club.<br>
</p>
<p>
'In the next few hours the information will be expanded.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The former Swansea, Tottenham and Juventus striker has scored 178 career goals in 601 games and will be hoping to add to that tally in his new surroundings at the Ipurua Municipal Stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
Eibar currently sit second in the Segunda Division, one point behind Almeria, as they look to make an instant return to LaLiga following last season's relegation.<br>

<h2>
The Toon 22: A.I. analysts name the players Newcastle's new owners MUST consider before January's transfer window... so they can ensure Premier League survival and THEN splash out on stars</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/15/49702703-0-image-a-63_1635343429343.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
Newcastle United have around 200million to spend and stay within FFP limits over the next three years</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
That might be limited to around 50-70m to invest in January, so as not to drive up prices for targets</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Recruitment specialist AiAbacus have analysed the market for Sportsmail and identified 22 potential signings</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Analysts say Newcastle will have a two-phase strategy:fight relegation in January, build from next summer</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Newcastle United's new owners face an enormous challenge in the transfer market as they balance the need for survival this season with a future assault on the top six, insist recruitment and financial analysts.<br>
</p>
<p>
Working with recruitment specialists AiAbacus, Sportsmail have scoured international football to find the best buys to keep Newcastle in the top tier this season, while leaving the bulk of the funds available for bigger signings later on.<br>
</p>
<p>
Top options include Fiorentina centre-backNikola Milenkovic, Marseille midfielder Boubacar Kamara, Borussia Monchengladbach's Denis Zakaria, Manchester United's Jesse Lingard and a host of potential strikers, likeSwitzerland forward Haris Seferovic, Nice's French frontman Amine Gouiri and Genk's Ebere Onuachu.<br>
</p>
<p>
And some more familiar faces have emerged, too, likeAlexandre Lacazette, Divock Origi and Dominic Solanke, all of whom know the Premier League well.<br>
</p>
<p>
The analysts have used artificial intelligence to match potential signings against the Magpies' current playing style and squad. The key in January, says AiAbacus data analyst Andy Forrester, is to buy players who hit the ground running and make an immediate impact on the battle for survival.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, there is a very delicate balance to be struck between what the new Saudi-backed owners spend now and what is then available in the future, because of the limitations imposed by Financial Fair Play rules.<br>
</p>
<p>
It is this balance that is believed to lie behind reports that Newcastle will 'only' look to spend 50million in the coming January transfer window, thereby saving the bulk of their war chest.<br>
</p>
<p>
Newcastle have plenty of centre backs, but not of adequate quality, both with and without the ball. The first challenge is to stop shipping goals. They have conceded more than any other team in the top flight this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ideally, Newcastle may want a ball-playing centre half, who can help them move away from their current style, but their perilous situation in the Premier League may dictate their options in January.Analysis by AiAbacus suggests the following players would be an improvement on what they already have.<br>
</p>
<p>
James Tarkowski, 28, (Burnley). Market value: 20m<br>
</p>
<p>
Pros: Contract expires in the summer reducing his value, still the right side of 30 and an experienced Premier League defender, who would be an improvement on current options.<br>
</p>
<p>
Cons: Burnley are relegation rivals and may be reluctant to sell and Newcastle may feel he doesn't fix the long-term problem of lack of a passing defender.<br>
</p>
<p>
John Brooks, 28, (Wolfsburg). Market value: 17m<br>
</p>
<p>
Pros: Contract expires in the summer, experienced international with 45 caps for the United States, he is good on the ball as well as a strong defender.<br>
</p>
<p>
Cons: It is a step up to the Premier League from the Bundesliga.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nikola Milenkovic, 24, (Fiorentina). Market value: 28m<br>
</p>
<p>
Pros: Talented international defender with 31 caps for Serbia, a very good age for long term development, a lot of potential. Fiorentina and Newcastle play a similar style.<br>
</p>
<p>
Cons: He needs a good coach. He has no Premier League experience and doesn't speak English, so may not be able to make the immediate impact required.<br>
</p>
<p>
While Kylian Mbappe and Harry Kane and the like might become future transfer targets, there would be little point in plunging them into a Premier League dogfight now, even if they would somehow consider coming.<br>
</p>
<p>
Newcastle need players who can fit in with the existing group and deliver immediately. That means people who can adapt to Newcastle's style, even though it may change in seasons to come, and who can be bought at a good price.<br>
</p>
<p>
'You would expect them to sign players in this window to secure Premier League survival,' said Dr Rob Wilson, an expert in sports business management at Sheffield Hallam University.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I would expect the investment in January to be around 60m to 70m and that makes a huge difference.<br>
</p>
<p>
'You would not go in and buy a Paul Pogba. Those players want to play for a team already at the top. I think they will be looking at mid-tier players, rather than top tier. Players who can push them up the division.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Under former boss Rafa Benitez, Sean Longstaff, 23, and Isaac Hayden, 26, looked a strong pair sitting in front of the defence. However, under Steve Bruce Newcastle's defence seems to have lost a lot of protection from midfield.<br>
</p>
<p>
They could bring in a traditional No 6 to solidify the defensive area, or alternatively work with Longstaff and Hayden and then recruit a player who offers more going forward in the form of a No 8 or No 10 to secure creativity/goals.<br>
</p>
<p>
Defensive Midfielders:<br>
</p>
<p>
Boubacar Kamara (Marseille). Market value: 25m<br>
</p>
<p>
Newcastle's recruitment department seem to have chased this player forever, with an offer rejected in the summer. They could return in January, now with stronger financial muscle and with the added bonus of the player entering the last six months of his contract. Marseille have offered an extension but Kamara doesn't seem to be willing to sign it so far, which may well lower his price. More of a No 6, having moved from originally playing centre back.<br>
</p>
<p>
Denis Zakaria (Borussia Monchengladbach). Market Value: 27.5m<br>
</p>
<p>
His contract is also up in the summer and he is considered a slightly better all-round player than Kamara and may end up costing more. Zakaria played 25 games in the Bundesliga last season and scored once; this term he has six appearances and two goals.<br>
</p>
<p>
Florian Grillitsch (Hoffenheim). Market Value: 23m<br>
</p>
<p>
Grillitsch's contract is also up in the summer and he is a versatile, hardworking ball player that can play at 6 or 8, thereby offering more flexibility. He is an ex-team-mate of Joelinton, increasing the chance he will hit the ground running. He may also be affordable in this window, given FFP constraints.<br>
</p>
<p>
Box-to-box midfielders:<br>
</p>
<p>
Florian Neuhaus (Borussia Monchengladbach). Market value: 34m<br>
</p>
<p>
This would be an exciting, albeit ambitious signing in terms of quality and cost. Neuhaus, whose contract runs until 2024, is a highly-talented young central midfielder, making his way into the German national side, and has recently been chased by Liverpool with rumours of long-term links to Bayern Munich. But money talks and this player would definitely be a statement of intent.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ross Barkley (Chelsea). Market value: Loan<br>
</p>
<p>
A temporary option. The stumbling block with other clubs has been Barkley's wages but this could be a sensible short-term solution.<br>
</p>
<p>
Attacking midfielders:<br>
</p>
<p>
Jesse Lingard (Manchester United). Market Value: 20m<br>
</p>
<p>
A proven talent, Lingard has the appetite to succeed and will want to play ahead of the World Cup. An experienced Premier League player with a point to prove - and his contract expires next summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Other options suggested by the AiAbacus analysis include,Jens-Lys Cajuste (Midtjylland; market value 6m), who is a talented young Swedish international looking for a step up to a better league. In addition, there isYoussouf Fofana (Monaco; market value 23m), a French youth international, strong in the tackle and capable of springing counter attacks, which suits Newcastle. <br>
</p>
<p>
Following the 305m takeover of the club from Mike Ashley, Newcastle are in an enviable financial position.<br>
</p>
<p>
The new owners, backed by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund may have money to burn, but their expenditure will initially be limited to around 200m in a three-year rolling period, due to the FFP rules and once some early commercial deals have been struck.<br>
</p>
<p>
So, what Newcastle spend now will eat into the cash they have available in the two-and-a-half years that follow.<br>
</p>
<p>
While Newcastle's reported desire to limit spending to just 50m in January may be something of a red herring - to dissuade selling clubs and agents from hiking their prices too much - it is unlikely the new owners will blow the budget in the first window.<br>
</p>
<p>
There are ways, albeit tricky, of limiting cost though.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think this is a difficult task,' Forrester, who advises Premier League and EFL clubs on transfer targets and best fit, told Sportsmail.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's extremely difficult for any Premier League club to recruit three or four players of adequate quality, who are a drastic improvement on what they currently have, with top-flight experience and a good fit for the club's system, without spending more than 50m.<br>
</p>
<p>
Newcastle have scored at a reasonable rate in the Premier League this season, with striker Callum Wilson prominent when fit. However, Wilson has missed four games with a hamstring injury and a similar issue kept him out of seven games last spring. Newcastle may well want to strengthen in this area.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Magpies could do well to build around a target man, with Wilson playing off him. Newcastle have decent crossers of the ball in Matt Ritchie, Ryan Fraser, Jacob Murphy and Jonjo Shelvey. So, a target man may work well in a system with a lot of balls into the box as an alternative to their counter-attacking style.<br>
</p>
<p>
Target man:<br>
</p>
<p>
Paul Onuachu, 27, (Genk). Market value: 21m<br>
</p>
<p>
A rangy striker, who netted 35 goals in Belgium last season. Onuachu is noted for his aerial ability and caused West Ham problems in the first half of their 3-0 Europa League win against Genk on Thursday, heading over and wide at 0-0.<br>
</p>
<p>
Finisher:<br>
</p>
<p>
Haris Seferovic, 29, (Benfica). Market value: 12.1m<br>
</p>
<p>
The experienced Swiss has 24 international goals in 82 appearances for his country. Known for his finishing, Seferovic has scored 69 times in 175 matches for Benfica since 2017. He is also noted for his pressing ability, which would help Newcastle defend from the front. Having missed most of this season with a muscle injury, Seferovic has fallen down the pecking order at Benfica and may relish a new challenge.<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
English experience:<br>
</p>
<p>
Dominic Solanke, 24, (Bournemouth). Market value: 11m<br>
</p>
<p>
Solanke has not yet fulfilled his potential in the Premier League, but is benefitting from consistent appearances in the Championship. He netted 15 goals in 40 league games last term. He has plenty of Premier League experience, but not a goal-scoring record in the top flight, so Newcastle may feel he does not add to what they already have.<br>
</p>
<p>
Versatile across frontline:<br>
</p>
<p>
Amine Gouiri, 21, (Nice). Market value: 30m<br>
</p>
<p>
Considered a bright prospect in France, Gouiri is a regular for the country's Under-21 side. He scored 12 times in 34 Ligue 1 appearances last season and has been on fire this term, netting five in nine games, with three assists. Gouiri would be an exciting investment, but January may not be the time.<br>
</p>
<p>
Other Options:<br>
</p>
<p>
The AiAbacus analysis includes lanky front manSasa Kalajdzic, 24, (Stuttgart; market value: 20m), who has been likened to Peter Crouch, but is currently sidelined with a shoulder injury.<br>
</p>
<p>
In addition, other options include, Danish forward, Jonas Wind, 22, (Copenhagen; market value 19m), Italian Gianluca Scamacca (Sassuolo; market value 13m); Frenchman Serhou Guirassy, 25, (Rennes; market value 17.9m); Spaniard Borja Mayoral, 24, (Roma, on loan from Real Madrid; market value 13m) and Swiss Breel Embolo, 24, (Borussia Monchengladbach, market value 14m).<br>
</p>
<p>
Closer to home with proven Premier League experience, Arsenals Alexandre Lacazette, 30, with 51 league goals for the Gunners in 131 top-flight appearances or Liverpools super-sub, Divock Origi, 26, could fit the bill.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think something would need to give.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But I agree that recruitment will have to be separated into two stages: Survival this season and a longer-term approach for future success from the summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's tricky in this window. Newcastle can't gamble too much on youth if they're in a relegation fight, but they also don't want to overspend on experience as if they do stay up they're then stuck with players on a potentially costly contract.<br>
</p>
<p>
'A smart policy would be to target a strong core spine throughout the squad, possibly with a focus on players nearing the end of contracts that could have a more immediate impact.'<br>

Dele Alli's Tottenham future called into question as he's LEFT OUT of trip to face Burnley in Carabao Cup tie, despite Nuno Espirito Santo calling it a 'final' and taking a full-strength squad</h2>

Tottenham haven't included Dele Alli in their Carabao Cup squad to play Burnley</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Nuno Espirito Santo says he will take a strong squad to Turf Moor on Wednesday</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The under-fire Spurs boss compared the Burnley clash to a 'final' on Tuesday</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Alli has not played a single minute of top-flight football since September 26</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Tottenham star Dele Alli's position in Nuno Espirito Santo's plans has been thrown into uncertainty with the midfielder set to be omitted from the squad to face Burnley on Wednesday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmailhas learned that Alli has not been included in the party that travels to Turf Moor for the Carabao Cup game that head coach Nuno described as a 'final'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Alli is not injured, with the Spurs head coach likely to point to the fact he has rotated his squad for the club's European and cup games this season as a reason for his absence.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the decision casts doubt over Alli's place within the Portuguese coach's plans moving forward, particularly given the midfielder has played a peripheral role in recent weeks.<br>
</p>
<p>
Alli played a key role for Nuno during the opening weeks of his reign, starting in the first six Premier League matches of the season - even scoring the winner against Wolves.<br>
</p>
<p>
But the 25-year-old was substituted at half-time of the north London derby loss to Arsenal on September 26 with the team trailing 3-0 at the break and hasn't played a single minute of top-flight football since.<br>
</p>
<p>
He was an unused substitute in Saturday's loss to West Ham and his wait for further minutes will extend into at least the weekend following the decision of Nuno to leave Alli in London.<br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking on Tuesday, when asked whether he would be taking his Premier League squad to Burnley, Spurs boss Nuno replied: 'Basically yes, but we have players that we need, players that are working hard, maybe with the expectation that they will have more minutes, the expectation that they deserve more minutes.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's going to be a tough match like we expect because Burnley is a good team but it's a good chance for us to improve, knowing that the Carabao Cup is an important competition for us. We have to go game-by-game and then this game is a final.'<br>

Elliot Dickman is set to take over as U23s coach after 26 years at Sunderland</b>

<li><b>

<li><b>
Newcastle's search for a new manager is now likely to move into a third week</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Newcastle are set to make the first significant appointment of the new Saudi-led regime, with Elliott Dickman taking over as Under-23s coach after 26 years at North-East rivals Sunderland.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail can reveal that the 43-year-old will fill the role that has been vacant since August, when Chris Hogg left to become assistant manager at MK Dons.<br>
</p>
<p>
Academy chief Steve Harper has led the search and has interviewed several candidates, including former Magpies striker Shefki Kuqi.<br>
</p>
<p>
But it is Dickman who has landed a position that is set to become integral to the future of the club, given the want of the new owners to invest in youth development.<br>
</p>
<p>
Dickman was a highly-rated youth-team player at Sunderland but was forced to retire aged 20 because of a persistent hip problem.<br>
</p>
<p>
He has risen through the coaching ranks on Wearside and, since 2017, he has been in charge of the Under-23s side. His departure will come as a shock to followers of Sunderland given his longstanding connection with the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Newcastles search for a new first-team boss is likely to enter a third week. Paulo Fonseca remains the bookies favourite after talks last week, but sources have suggested he is not necessarily the frontrunner.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lucien Favre, Unai Emery and Roberto Martinez were three names still being discussed over the weekend.<br>

Harry Winks' long-term future at Tottenham is under increasing uncertainty as Nuno Espirito Santo leaves midfielder at home for their Carabao Cup clash with Burnley</h2>

<p>
Tottenhammidfielder Harry Winks' long-term future is under increasing uncertainty after he was left out of the squad for Wednesday's trip to Burnley.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Spurs academy graduate has not made the trip north for the Carabao Cup clash at Turf Moor to place further doubt on his position within Nuno Espirito Santo's plans.<br>
</p>
<p>
Winks was a glaring omission from the match-day squad for Sunday's loss at West Ham, the England midfielder not even making the bench.<br>
</p>
<p>
But his omission from the party to face Sean Dyche's side raises major questions over the academy graduate's future at the club he supported as a boy.<br>
</p>
<p>
Winks started in last week's Europea Conference League clash against Vitesse Arnhem and spoke about his lack of action under Nuno so far.<br>
</p>
<p>
'No. No, I can't [understand it]. But listen, the circumstances are that I'm in this situation. Of course [my confidence is low],' explained Winks.<br>
</p>
<p>
'When players are not playing well and you only have yourself to blame, it's difficult. I want to be at my best, firing and playing really well. It comes with games. But ultimately it comes with me performing on the pitch when I get the opportunity.<br>
</p>
<p>
'If I'm not doing that, then I only have myself to blame. I'm man enough to admit that I need to improve in certain areas. On the contrary, I need to play games and the only way to [improve] is getting minutes and getting that sharpness back.'<br>
</p>
<p>
His non-selection for Tottenham's two games since the defeat in Holland last Thursday may be a reaction from Nuno to Winks' comments.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Winks' peripheral role at Tottenham is set to lead to a potential exit from the club he came through the ranks to captain.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail exclusively revealed last night that Dele Alli had also failed to make the squad.<br>

Jose Mourinho is accused of creating an 'uncomfortable situation' within the Roma squad by Amadou Diawara's agent after midfielder was one of four players BANISHED after humiliating 6-1 defeat to Norwegians Bodo/Glimt</h2>

<ul><li><b>
Angry Jose Mourinho cut four players from his squad after defeat last week</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
A second string Roma team were thrashed 6-1 in Europa Conference League</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Amadou Diawara was among those not selected for next two matchday squads</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Midfielder's agent has accused Mourinho of splitting the Roma dressing room</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Amadou Diawara's agent has slammed Jose Mourinho for banishing the midfielder from his Roma squad and creating an 'uncomfortable situation' at the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Guinea International was one of four players ostracised by Mourinho in the wake of last week's embarrassing 6-1 defeat by Norwegians Bodo/Glimt in the UEFA Europa Conference League.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mourinho claimed after the loss that his fringe players were inadequate and that 'he only has 13 players' in his squad who are up to scratch.<br>
</p>
<p>
He dropped Diawara, Borja Mayoral, Gonzalo Villar and Bryan Reynolds from his squad entirely for the Serie A game against Napoli on Sunday and they have not been picked for Wednesday night's trip to Cagliari either.<br>
</p>
<p>
And Diawara's agent Daniele Piraino told Tuttomercatoweb: 'I don't understand the message he's trying to get across.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Is Diawara being made a scapegoat? Is he being made to pay a heavy price for an error? Or is an attempt to force the club into acting in the transfer market?<br>
</p>
<p>
'If it is for these reasons, rather than just poor fitness, or he feels the player is unable to understand the tactical requirements of the coach, then I think Mourinho is creating an uncomfortable situation.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It is inexplicable but Diawara will adapt. Amadou is an exceptional professional.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Diawara, 24, was linked with a move away from the Stadio Olimpico over the summer and has only played seven minutes in Serie A anyway this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
But he had featured more regularly in Europe, starting two of Roma's Conference League group matches.<br>
</p>
<p>
Not holding back after the defeat to Bodo/Glimt,Mourinho said: 'They have more quality than us. Their first team is a much better team than our second team.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's my mistake. I wanted to rest players after the game against Juventus and before the game against Napoli. I made these decisions, and in the end, they are better players than my players. They are a better team than my team.<br>

'Of course, the 6-1 could be five, could be seven, could be eight. The game went in a direction where you lose complete control of emotions, of everything. The reality of the game is that the best team won with the best players.<br>

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer faces a battle to cling on to his job at Manchester United</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The 5-0 thrashing at home against Liverpool has left him under huge pressure</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Pundits including Jamie Carragher have called for United to get a 'better' boss</b>

 Gary Neville is among those who have resisted calls for United to swing the axe</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer faces the toughest period of his Manchester United career so far as the calls for his sacking intensified following their humiliating 5-0 home defeat to Liverpool on Sunday.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Norwegian has faced pressure in the past, but nothing like this as his team were put to the sword in their biggest game of the season - with Jurgen Klopp's men racing into a 4-0 lead at the break.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pundits have been having their say on Solskjaer's future all season long, with United guilty of some poor results before their hammering at the hands of Liverpool.<br>
</p>
<p>
But the manner of the latest defeat has left even the most conservative of pundits admitting his time could soon be up.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail examines the views of football's biggest pundits and what they think should be done on the future of Solskjaer.<br>
</p>
<p>
STAY<br>
</p>
<p>
Gary Neville<br>
</p>
<p>
By far Solskjaer's biggest cheerleader having played alongside him, Neville has not been afraid of criticising the Norwegian this season but has stopped short of calling for his sacking, saying he will never demand for any manager to lose his job.<br>
</p>
<p>
Before the Liverpool thrashing, Neville was adamant that he would not give into pressure from fans and suggest that Solskjaer deserved to be sacked.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I've got Manchester United fans on my social media all of the time saying, "Gary, he's your mate. You won't call him out,"' he told Sky Sports last week.<br>
</p>
<p>
'No, I won't. I won't call Steve Kean out, or Arsene Wenger at Arsenal. I'm not going to come on this show 11 years later and ask for a manager to be sacked. It's never going to happen. He's a club legend. He's my team-mate. I actually like him a lot.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Manchester United have failed with two previous managers who have been world class. I think they persist until the end of the season.'<br>
</p>
<p>
After witnessing United fall apart against Liverpool, Neville was thrown into a back and forth debate with fellow pundit Jamie Carragher over his defence of Solskjaer as he refused to change his view and insists the club will 'hold their nerve' due to the current ownership set-up.<br>
</p>
<p>
'If this was in the immediate post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, Ole would be under massive pressure tonight,' he added after the clash at Old Trafford.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But I think the club will hold their nerve. I don't think they have planned for a new manager this season. I think they will sit with him until the end of the season. There will be a massive outcry from fans and media that Ole should be sacked and I can understand that after that game. It was a monstrously bad day and it takes some recovery from.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But I think this club is a lot more stable in terms of the ownership - I think now might be the time for them to communicate with the fans if they are going to back the manager for the next six to eight months, which I think they will.<br>
</p>
<p>
'They have said they believe in the projects even though there will be some bumps. Ole says they are close. I am not convinced because I look at those players and the other teams are really good and Man Utd are nowhere near as good. I want to see a structured, organised performance. I believe the club are stable and will not sack the manager but they have to get back on the bike.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Bryan Robson<br>
</p>
<p>
Unlike Neville, former Manchester United midfielder Bryan Robson never played alongside Solskjaer but stressed it was 'not the time' to swing the axe on the boss.<br>
</p>
<p>
The former Red Devils captain admitted the result against Liverpool was 'embarrassing' but pointed out that making a change wouldn't necessarily work and that there were a lack of suitable alternatives.<br>
</p>
<p>
'This was embarrassing but you can't say it hasn't been coming,' he said in his column for Sportsmail.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The pressing game that United have tried to adopt just isn't working. The players are not adjusting to whatever Ole is asking them to do and the system needs to change.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The best performances from this team in recent seasons have come from being compact, strong defensively and hitting teams on the counter attack.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But it's not the time to sack Ole. I do believe he will keep his job. It's easy to clamour for the manager to go after such a painful defeat but change now causes more upheaval.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The club have found that changes every couple of years just don't work and who do you replace him with? I'm not sure there's a candidate who can make such a significant difference without causing major disruption again.'<br>
</p>
<p>
GO<br>
</p>
<p>
Jamie Carragher<br>
</p>
<p>
Liverpool legend Carragher had cutting words for Solskjaer in the build up to the game with his old side - saying United needed a 'better manager', although the Norwegian dismissed it as mind games to help his beloved Reds win.<br>
</p>
<p>
But speaking after the 5-0 loss, Carragher bickered with Neville about Solskjaer and reiterated his view and said he honestly felt that Solskjaer - while praising the job he had done so far - was 'not good enough' for the Man United post.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think Ole has done a good job but to take on Klopp, Tuchel and Pep, Manchester United need a better manager,' he told Sky Sports.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I wasn't saying that on Monday in a disrespectful way, I feel for Ole - that will be the darkest day in his career.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I don't want to get involved in a slanging match, I know Ole said something back and rightly so.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I'm not comfortable saying someone should be sacked - but we are comfortable saying Fred is not good enough or Scott McTominay is not good enough so I do not feel too bad saying Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is not good enough.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Manchester United should have the best in class - the best managers and coaches in the world. If you have Ole as the manager you should have someone like Carlos Queiroz as the assistant coach.<br>
</p>
<p>
'You cannot have people learning on the job who have never been at the club of that size. They have got Mike Phelan but I do not think he's a coach, there's Michael Carrick and Kieren McKenna, they have never coached anyone in their lives.<br>
</p>
<p>
'You have got to have someone who has been there and done it. You cannot be learning on the job at Manchester United.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Chris Sutton<br>
</p>
<p>
Former Blackburn and Celtic striker Chris Sutton believes Solskjaer has run out of time to prove he still has the quality to lead United to silverware and said it was a matter of time before he was axed.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sutton has previously been downbeat on United's chances of challenging for the title and believes the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo has hindered the team, and now thinks Solskjaer is on the chopping block after failing to produce with three high profile signings given to him this summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We've stuck up for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but he's been there for almost three years now,' Sportsmail's Sutton told BBC Radio 5Live.<br>
</p>
<p>
'And with the signings at the start of the season you were thinking they have to challenge for the title, but I really don't see any other way. He has to go, surely?'<br>
</p>
<p>
Micah Richards<br>
</p>
<p>
Another Sportsmail columnist in Micah Richards, who played for United's bitter rivals Man City for many years, was reluctant to say Solskjaer should be sacked but admitted he looked 'out of his depth' after the Liverpool defeat.<br>
</p>
<p>
He suggested the club will soon be forced to make a decision on Solskjaer's future if things did not continue but urged United to take action either way.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He has such a legendary status at the club so it was always going to be difficult when things come to this,' Richards said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It has to be down to the coaching and some of the things were ridiculous, basic mistakes. They don't know when to press or when to drop deep and it looks like Ole does not know what to do.<br>
</p>
<p>
'They need to back him and say he will go to the end of the season or bring someone else in.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I feel sorry for him, looking at a person who has this legendary status but he looks a bit out of his depth. If that can't be resolved they need to move forward.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Jason Cundy<br>
</p>
<p>
The talkSPORT host and former Chelsea defender had already called for Solskjaer's sacking last month after suffering a 2-1 defeat against Young Boys, with the unfancied Swiss outfit scoring in stoppage time in their Champions League match-up.<br>
</p>
<p>
Cundy did not hold back on Solskjaer and his tactics, calling him 'clueless' and questioning why he failed to make changes after going down to 10 men, despite the opposition tinkering with their system.<br>
</p>
<p>
'That there shows he's utterly clueless,' Cundy told talkSPORT.<br>
</p>
<p>
'That performance, the team shape they went down to 10 men, yes, but come on. They went to five at the back and he didn't change it.<br>
</p>
<p>
'They were getting overrun in the middle of the park. Poor Fred, Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes. I've got so much sympathy for them, they had no help, they were getting passed around.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Cundy said he would pull the trigger now if he was on the Manchester United board and suggested former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte as a successor.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It exposed Ole, it did badly. I'd sack him. We know what's coming, don't we? You've got Antonio Conte out there<br>
</p>
<p>
'Who's the better manager? There will be a stage in the season where they'll be like "I wish we did it earlier".<br>
</p>
<p>
On the fence<br>
</p>
<p>
Paul Merson<br>
</p>
<p>
Former Arsenal midfielder and Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson took issue with Solskjaer after their defeat to Young Boys last month and insisted that Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, Man City boss Pep Guardiola or even former United boss Jose Mourinho would have won the game.<br>
</p>
<p>
He didn't call for his sacking but believes Solskjaer lacks the ability to make big calls in pivotal games.<br>
</p>
<p>
'This is why the jury's out on Solskjaer. Seven defeats in their last 11 Champions League games, that's a phenomenal record.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He panicked. If I put Tuchel in charge there, Guardiola or Mourinho, Man United do not lose that game. Man United win that game.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Merson was left baffled by Solskjaer's failure to introduce Mason Greenwood and accused him of 'people pleasing' after the arrival of Ronaldo at Old Trafford.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Greenwood is on the bench, he has to come. I'm not even a manager anymore, and I know that. If I know that, why doesn't he know that?<br>
</p>
<p>
'I worry, because it seemed to me it was people pleasing. He kept Ronaldo on for a long, long time in the game. Put Greenwood up front and you can counter attack.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Man United have not been playing well. They should have got well beaten at Wolves.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Against Newcastle last week, at 1-1, it was heads or tails. And then they go and get beaten by a pub team in Champions League football terms.<br>
</p>
<p>
'You've got to be tactically good enough to say "right, I need to change things".'<br>
</p>
<p>
Peter Crouch<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail'sPeter Crouch, who went up against Solskjaer in his Liverpool days, also made the comparison between the Norwegian and his managerial rivals Tuchel, Guardiola and Klopp, insisting United would 'work harder' if any of those three were in charge.<br>
</p>
<p>
Just like Merson, he claimed Solskjaer was afraid to 'upset players' and said the team lacked a manager who was going to be strict and haul people off when showing a poor attitude.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think if Pep and Klopp are in charge of this (United) team, I think the front four would work a lot harder, no way they would get away with it,' Crouch told BT Sport. 'Don't think Ole will upset players.'<br>
</p>
<p>
'I see body language on some players that under Pep and Klopp they would be hauled off. Arms thrown recently, that I don't like, needs to be nipped in the bud, those two would have made sure it was.<br>
</p>
<p>
'David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne were the two hardest working players when City pumped us in a game a while back, I don't see that at United.'<br>
</p>
<p>
'Ole has come from Cardiff and Molde, managing Manchester United, unfortunately they do not have a manager of the experience of Pep, Tuchel, and Klopp.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Paul Scholes<br>
</p>
<p>
He is never afraid of giving his opinion or a stinging attack on his former side United but Scholes has so far resisted the opportunity to call for his old team-mate's head.<br>
</p>
<p>
Scholes believes Solskjaer can turn United's fortunes around but said he would have to take responsibility for the Liverpool thrashing and admitted the team's set up for the match was 'not quite right'.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It was a humiliating day for everyone involved with the club: the fans especially, the players worse I suppose and the manager worst of all.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He will feel responsible for that. To be fair, I think when you're playing against a team like Liverpool, the way the team was set up wasn't quite right.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The legendary midfielder said Solskjaer's only hope was to keep fighting and find a way to 'galvanise' the team, starting with the next trip to Spurs.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Can he turn it around? I hope so. We played with Ole for years and he's a resolute character.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He came out fighting and at the end of the day it's only three points. You don't get anything more, you don't get anything less.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's a little bit embarrassing but now he's got to try and galvanise the team and try and find a way forward.'<br>

Sergio Aguero ready to make first Barcelona start for under pressure boss Ronald Koeman at Rayo Vallecano - but the Barca boss will be without Ansu Fati who has been ruled out with a knee injury</h2>

<ul><li><b>
Sergio Aguero has already featured three times from off the Barcelona bench</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
But he is now set to make his first start for the club on Wednesday evening</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
However, his chance comes after Ansu Fati was ruled out injured for Barca</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Ronald Koeman is under pressure at Barca, with his side just ninth in LaLiga table</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Sergio Aguero will finally make his full debut for Barcelona on Wednesday evening when they make the trip to Rayo Vallecano in LaLiga.<br>
</p>
<p>
Aguero joined Barca in the summer upon the expiry of his Manchester City contract but has missed most of the season so far after picking up a calf injury shortly after his arrival.<br>
</p>
<p>
However having come off the bench in recent games against Valencia, Dynamo Kiev and the defeat by Real Madrid, Koeman now trusts the Argentina international to lead the Barca attack from the start.<br>
</p>
<p>
Koeman's hand for the game has been forced though, as he is unable to select promising young forward Ansu Fati who has been ruled out with a knee injury.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 18-year-old limped off near the end of the defeat by Madrid in what has already been a frustrating year fitness wise for the 18-year-old.<br>
</p>
<p>
Fati has only just returned from 11 months out while also having had knee surgery at the start of the year.<br>
</p>
<p>
But he has been a rare bright hope in a rocky start to the campaign for Koeman's side having scored twice in four appearances.<br>
</p>
<p>
Aguero is expected to lead Barca's attack flanked by Memphis Depay and Sergino Dest as Koeman desperately seeks a win to kickstart their season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Already Barcelona are in danger of slipping away in the title race after falling six points behind early pace setters Real Sociedad, albeit having played a game fewer.<br>
</p>
<p>
However defeat in El Clasico at home to Madrid was a damaging result and leaves them five points behind their rivals who sit second in the table but they too have a game in hand.<br>
</p>
<p>
Koeman also has other injuries to contend with, including Frenkie de Jong, Pedri and Ousmane Dembele.<br>
</p>
<p>
Playing behind the Barca frontline, Koeman is expected to field a pairing of Gavi and Sergi Roberto anchored by veteran Sergio Busquets.<br>
</p>
<p>
Newly promoted Vallecano head into the game a point and a place above Barca in the table and are expected to lead with an attack featuring ex-Manchester United and Chelsea striker Radamel Falcao.<br>

Eden Hazard set to play for Real Madrid against Osasuna, having been left on the bench during El Clasico win, as Spanish media claim Carlo Ancelotti has 'poked' the forward to motivate him</h2>

<ul><li><b>
Eden Hazard played no role in Real Madrid's win over Barcelona at the weekend</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Manager Carlo Ancelotti has preferred to play Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
However, Ancelotti has challenged Hazard to rediscover his best form</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The Belgian is set to return to action against Osasuna but only as a substitute</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Eden Hazard could be set to return to the Real Madrid fold on Wednesday evening when Real Madrid take on Osasuna in LaLiga, after he was 'poked' by boss Carlo Ancelotti.<br>
</p>
<p>
Despite returning from a muscle injury, the Belgian was surprisingly only an unused substitute for  Ancelotti's side in the 2-1 victory over rivals Barcelonalast weekend.<br>
</p>
<p>
There were concerns that the 30-year-old, who has struggled badly with injuries since joining from Chelsea two years ago in a 89million deal, was still not fully fit.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Ancelotti has since revealed that the Belgian forward has fallen down the pecking order behind the likes of Vinicius Jnr and Rodrygo.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ancelotti said: 'Hazard is ready, but his problem right now is that he has a coach who prefers other players, which can happen in a squad like this one.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The important thing is that he stays motivated and works hard so that he can play again, and he is doing that.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He just needs to put up with this situation for now, as sometimes the coach can prefer other players.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Spanish daily Marca claimed Ancelotti had 'poked' Hazard with his comments, however AS also wrote that the ex-Chelsea star will return to the fold against Osasuna after leading with a headline of 'another train for Hazard'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Although the Belgian is not expected to start, he is set to feature at the very least as a substitute.<br>
</p>
<p>
Hazard has started just five games this season and Madrid legend Fernando Morientes told Sportsmail that Madrid will not wait forever for the diminutive attacker to rediscover his best form in Spain.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Madrid tends to be very patient with these types of players,' Morientes, who was a three-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We know Hazard is very good, but there will probably be a time when Real Madrid will have to make a decision.<br>
</p>
<p>
'This year is a decisive year, it's crucial for him and he will have to demonstrate what he's got.'<br>

Solskjaer stays... FOR NOW: Manchester United boss given more time to turn things around after 5-0 Liverpool mauling - but he fears for his long-term future with board set to review his position in December</h2>

<ul><li><b>
Manchester United will keep Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the club  for now</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The Norwegian oversaw an 'embarrassing' 5-0 home loss by Liverpool last week</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The United board planned to review him in December and that is still the same</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Sir Alex Ferguson paid a visit to Manchester United training on Tuesday</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is set for a stay of execution as Manchester United manager but is still fearing for his long-term future at the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer took training at Carrington on Tuesday for the first time since Uniteds 5-0 thrashing by Liverpool, a display labelled embarrassing by senior players.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Norwegian is preparing the team for Saturdays trip to Tottenham amid a backdrop of intense scrutiny and some members of his squad questioning whether the slide can be halted under his management.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail understandsthat United  who gave Solskjaer a new three-year contract over the summer  were planning to review the 48-year-olds position in December.<br>
</p>
<p>
The galling surrender at Old Trafford last weekend has, however, accelerated that process. Board-level talks between co-chairman Joel Glazer, Ed Woodward and managing director Richard Arnold took place on Monday.<br>
</p>
<p>
United had not been prepared for such a dire run of results, with Solskjaers side losing five of their last nine games.<br>
</p>
<p>
The clubs board has so far resisted the calls for change, with the Norwegian expected to remain in charge at Spurs. Sir Alex Ferguson and former chairman Martin Edwards visited Carrington on Tuesday afternoon, with United insisting the pair were attending a pre-planned commitment.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ferguson has been a champion of his former striker and there has always been reticence to change at the top when United have fallen on troubling spells of form in previous campaigns.<br>
</p>
<p>
Yet Solskjaer now faces three huge games  Tottenham, a Champions League clash at Atalanta and then the derby against Pep Guardiolas Manchester City  that look likely to determine his prospects.<br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer is currently in the middle of a rare full week on the training ground in an attempt to arrest the slump in form.<br>
</p>
<p>
Some players have privately raised concern over the tempo of sessions and believe they are being consistently outsmarted tactically by opponents.<br>
</p>
<p>
Glazer, based in Florida, has been watching developments with interest but senior United sources were adamant last night that no approaches for potential successors had been made after Antonio Conte, the former Chelsea boss, expressed an interest in a move.<br>
</p>
<p>
Although formerly of Liverpool, Leicester Citys Brendan Rodgers has admirers at United  along with Ajaxs Erik ten Hag.<br>

<p>
Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has revealed that Ben White, Kieran Tierney and Martin Odegaard could be available for Saturday's Premier League clash with Leicester.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal progressed past Leeds United in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night withoutTierney and Odegaard.<br>
</p>
<p>
The pair were left out of the squad due tominor injuries. White started the game before being substituted in the second half after struggling with a sickness 'bug'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking after their 2-0 victory, Arteta said that White was struggling with a similar bug thatruled Pablo Mari out of the game.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Gunners boss said: 'There is a bug going on. We lost Pablo today as well as he wasn't feeling great.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Ben had it as well for the last day or two. He wasn't feeling great, so we decided to take him off.'<br>
</p>
<p>
He also gave an update on Tierney - who has been out of action since last week with a bruised ankle that forced him to sit out Arsenal's 3-1 win over Aston Villa - andOdegaard - who came on during that game but picked up a knock.<br>
</p>
<p>
He said thatTierney and Odegaard were not feeling 'good enough to be selected' for their Carabao Cup clash, but admitted he was hopeful they would be 'available' for Saturday's clash withLeicester. <br>
</p>
<p>
When asked to give an update after their game against Leeds,Arteta said:'They were both [Tierney and Odegaard] out with two different injuries.<br>
</p>
<p>
'They tried yesterday but they didn't feel great.They wanted to be involved, but they weren't good enough to be selected today.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Hopefully in the next few days they can feel better and they can be available for Leicester.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Arsenal will still be withoutlong-term absentee Granit Xhaka during their Premier League fixture on Saturday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Xhaka has been out of action ever since the North London derby after sustainingsignificant' damage to the medial ligament in his right knee.<br>

The midfielder did not need surgey but was told he would be out of action for around three months following his collision with Spurswinger Lucas Moura.<br>

<p>
Given the nod by Mikel Arteta to replace Ben White in the 55th minute, Chambers raced straight into the Leeds area as Emile Smith Rowe prepared to swing in a corner.<br>
</p>
<p>
It was more out of hope than anything else. Prior to Tuesday night Chambers had scored four times for Arsenal since arriving in 2016.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Leno; Soares, White (Chambers, 55), Holding (Tavares, 76), Kolasinac; Elneny (Lokonga, 72), Maitland-Niles; Pepe, Smith-Rowe (Lacazette, 72), Martinelli; Nketiah<br>
</p>
<p>
Subs not used: Balogun, Partey, Saka, Ramsdale<br>
</p>
<p>
Scorers: Chambers (55), Nketiah (69)<br>
</p>
<p>
Booked: Soares<br>
</p>
<p>
Manager: Mikel Arteta<br>
</p>
<p>
Leeds United (4-2-3-1): Meslier; Dallas, Struijk, Llorente (Cooper, 59), Drameh; Phillips, Forshaw (Klich, 46); Harrison, Roberts (Gelhardt, 53), James (Summerville, 70); Rodrigo (Greenwood, 70)<br>
</p>
<p>
Subs not used: Cresswell, Fuhr Hjelde, Klaesson, McKinstry<br>
</p>
<p>
Scorers: None<br>
</p>
<p>
Booked: Roberts<br>
</p>
<p>
Manager: Marcelo Bielsa<br>
</p>
<p>
He hadn't scored for the club since a 3-2 win over Aston Villa in September in 2019.<br>
</p>
<p>
Well, he's scored another one, this time firing Arsenal into the Carabao Cup quarter-finals with his first touch of the ball.<br>
</p>
<p>
By the end the Gunners won this at a canter, Eddie Nketiah adding a second as Arteta's men eased home.<br>
</p>
<p>
But this night belonged to one man.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Nico [Jover] the set-piece coach said you're going to score from your first touch,' said Chambers.<br>
</p>
<p>
'That's why I went running over to him. It was good, it was a nice moment.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Of course, Arteta won't care who scores. And, whisper it quietly, Arsenal have now gone eight matches without defeat.<br>
</p>
<p>
After a tough start to the season, Arteta's finally getting a tune out of his team, though Saturday's trip to Leicester will provide a far stiffer test of their recent resurgence.<br>
</p>
<p>
They certainly didn't have everything their own way here against Leeds; not that Arteta will give an iota about that.<br>
</p>
<p>
The first half didn't provide much in the way of clear cut chances.<br>
</p>
<p>
The slow burn was to be expected, perhaps.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal made nine changes from the team that beat Aston Villa on Friday night, while Leeds' four alterations from the side that drew with Wolves at the weekend included a full debut for 19-year-old Cody Drameh.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal made most of the early running without really threatening Illan Meslier, striker Nketiah and Sead Kolasinac both firing off target.<br>
</p>
<p>
Leeds, though, won't have been overly concerned. Indeed, as the game evolved the visitor's emerged much the stronger.<br>
</p>
<p>
Had Dan James collected Diego Llorente's raking pass from deep inside his own area then Leeds would surely have taken the lead.<br>
</p>
<p>
Similarly, Bernd Leno had to be alert to Jack Harrison's low effort after Arsenal failed to sufficiently clear a Leeds corner in the 27th minute.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tyler Roberts then fired a curling effort beyond the far post with Leno rooted to the spot as Leeds searched for the opener their opening 45 minutes probably deserved.<br>
</p>
<p>
The signs were promising for Marcelo Bielsa's team, their play was slick - appearing a far more cohesive unit than Arsenal. Making nine changes will do that to a team, of course. And in fairness to Arsenal, it wasn't like they were gasping for air.<br>
</p>
<p>
Playing within themselves? Yes, for sure. But had Smith Rowe's half-volley flown just a few inches lower then the Gunners may even have taken a half-time lead.<br>
</p>
<p>
The concern for Bielsa at half-time would have been missing the boat. They dominated large parts of the first-half without scoring the goal they'd have felt they deserved.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal's bright opening to the second period would only have enhanced that feeling. Nicolas Pepe and Cedric Soares were making significant inroads down the right while half-time appeared to flick a switch in Gabriel Martinelli.<br>
</p>
<p>
There was, however, some concern over first-choice central defender White, who trudged off to be replaced by Chambers following lengthy treatment.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arteta insisted his key defender was simply feeling the effects of bug, his substitution a precaution ahead the trip to Leicester. But White's illness was a mere footnote, this was Chambers' night.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Arsenal defender immediately took his position in the Leeds penalty area after his introduction; the rest was a blur.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pepe's header back across the face of goal from Smith Rowe's set piece had Leeds in a panic; Chambers nodded home to apply the finishing touch.<br>
</p>
<p>
Meslier made a gallant effort to deny the Arsenal substitute, the keeper's initial save from Chambers eventually cleared by Leeds.<br>
</p>
<p>
But the ball so clearly crossed the line; Andre Marriner confirming, after a quick look at his watch, soon after.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chambers frenziedly raced straight back to the bench to receive the adulation before his team-mates frantically besieging him.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nketiah completed the scoring 11 minutes later to remind Arteta of his credentials - but there was room for only one hero.<br>

Phil Neville gives his backing to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer despite Man United's 'sickening' 5-0 loss to Liverpool as under-fire boss is given time to turn things around at Old Trafford</h2>

<ul><li><b>
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be given chance to turn things around at Man United</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
He has survived the sack - for now - after 5-0 thrashing by Liverpool on Sunday</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
United head to Tottenham in their next match in Premier League on Saturday</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Solskjaer has received the backing of old team-mate Phil Neville amid crisis</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Neville described loss to Liverpool as 'a sickening blow' for Manchester United</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Phil Neville has backed his old team-mate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to turn things around at Manchester United in the wake of Sunday's 5-0 thrashing by Liverpool.<br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer has been granted a stay of execution after fears he would be sacked in the wake of the humiliating result at Old Trafford.<br>
</p>
<p>
United head to Tottenham on Saturday for what is now a must-win match with Solskjaer and his methods under greater scrutiny than ever.<br>
</p>
<p>
But he has received support from Inter Miami coach Neville, who played alongside him at United between 1996 and 2005.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I've played on United teams that lost 5-0,' he told the Miami Herald.<br>
</p>
<p>
'These things happen in football. I think the sensationalism of everything now is just out of control.<br>
</p>
<p>
'United lost a game of football 5-0 to Liverpool. Yes, it hurt. Yes, it was probably a real sickening blow for everybody that's ever played, supported or been involved with Manchester United - but it's as if United have never lost 5-0 ever in their history.<br>
</p>
<p>
'This has happened and United bounced back and won things. I lost at St James' Park 5-0. Philippe Albert chipped Peter Schmeichel and it felt no different.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The only difference was there was not a billion people on Twitter thinking they knew best about this, that and the other.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Neville didn't play in his cited 5-0 defeat by Newcastle United in October 1996 but he was involved when Alex Ferguson's team went down 6-3 at Southampton a week later.<br>
</p>
<p>
He also played in United's midfield when they lost 5-0 to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in October 1999.<br>
</p>
<p>
Neville is coach of MLS side Inter Miami, owned by his former team-mate David Beckham, and they face an uphill struggle to reach the play-offs as they head to Atlanta on Wednesday night.<br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer has been spared the sack for now but United are planning to review the 48-year-old's position in December. He was given a new three-year contract over the summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Norwegian received high-profile backing from legendary manager Ferguson when he visited the training ground on Tuesday.<br>

<h2>
Automated offside system is 'set to be used at 2022 World Cup and could be in the Premier League by 2023' with Hawk-Eye cameras capable of pinging a decision to VAR officials within half-a-second</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/06/49686821-0-image-m-18_1635312483315.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
New Hawk-Eye technology is set to determine offside calls in football games</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
System used 12 cameras around a stadium to track each player and the ball</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
It can calculate within half-a-second whether a player is offside or onside</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Verdict will be beamed to VAR officials who will make the final decision</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Automated system 'is on course to be used at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar'</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The technology could be a part of the Premier League in time for 2023-24</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Technology that automatically detects whether a player is offside is on course to be used at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and could be in the Premier League by 2023.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Hawk-Eye system uses cameras to track the movement of both the ball and the players to determine whether a player is offside or onside at the moment a pass is made.<br>
</p>
<p>
At first, it will work as a semi-automated system which sends a message to the video assistant referee (VAR), who then decides whether the offside player was interfering with play.<br>
</p>
<p>
But ultimately the technology could mean officials on the pitch are notified instantly as to whether a player is offside or not.<br>
</p>
<p>
Hawk-Eye have been staging non-live tests of their technology at the stadiums of Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City - the Premier League's four Champions League representatives - this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
And, according to The Times, the company has informed FIFA the technology is 'ready to go' with just over a year left until the World Cup.<br>
</p>
<p>
FIFA must approve use of the automated offside technology, which could also feature at February's FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, a tournament which will involve Chelsea.<br>
</p>
<p>
Referees' chiefs are confident the technology could be implemented in the Premier League by the start of the 2023-24 season.<br>
</p>
<p>
FIFA is believed to prefer the semi-automated option in which VAR officials are notified of the Hawk-Eye verdict and then make the final judgement.<br>
</p>
<p>
It would replace the sometimes contentious VAR 'lines' system used to judge whether an attacker is offside.<br>
</p>
<p>
But it is possible to notify the on-field referee and two linesman of the decision right away.<br>
</p>
<p>
The system makes use of 12 cameras positioned around the pitch and also artificial intelligence that monitors 29 points on each player's body using a 'skeletal player-tracking system.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The ball's movement is also tracked and computers will be able to determine an offside call within 0.5 seconds of real time.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsene Wenger, FIFA's chief of global football development, gave his backing to the automated offside technology earlier this year.<br>
</p>
<p>
He said: 'Automated means it goes directly from the signal to the linesman and the linesman has on his watch a red light that tells him offside or not offside.<br>
</p>
<p>
'At the moment, we have situation where the players are on lines to see if they are offside or not.<br>
</p>
<p>
'On average, the time we have to wait is around 70 seconds, sometimes one minute 20 seconds, sometimes a little bit longer when the situation is very difficult to appreciate.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It is so important because we see many celebrations are cancelled after that for marginal situations and that's why I believe it is a very important step.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Two weeks ago, Wenger added on the subject: 'In 2022 at the World Cup, we'll be much better able to make very quick offside decisions. And it will stop the game less because that is what the VAR can be faulted with.'<br>

<h2>
Hollywood goes to Maidenhead! Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney jet in to watch conference side Wrexham for the first time since taking over and investing 2m... but the 10-man Welsh side are beaten 3-2</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/08/49688699-0-image-m-21_1635318067596.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney arrived at Maidenhead to watch Wrexham</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
It is their first experience of watching the Welsh club since they took charge</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Wrexham made a disastrous start as they went 2-0 down and had a man sent off</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
They rallied like a Hollywood film to make it 2-2 but eventually lost the game 3-2</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Sportsmail revealed they would be flying over from the United States this week</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney got a first taste of life as a football owner as they jetted in to the UK and went to straight to Maidenhead to watch Wrexham's latest match.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail reportedthat the Hollywood pair, who invested 2million when they finalised the deal to buy Wrexham in February, would be travelling over from the United States this week to watch their first match since purchasing the club in February.<br>
</p>
<p>
They arrived minutes before kick-off to a barrage of camera flashes and were carefully escorted into the stand by an extensive security team.<br>
</p>
<p>
McElhenney sported a puffy Wrexham jacket, accompanied by a Wrexham AFC snapback hat, while Reynolds chose a navy coat and a darker overcoat for the cold Tuesday night match.<br>
</p>
<p>
Things got off to a rocky start for the Hollywood stars as Kane Ferdinand put Maidenhead United ahead on the break to make it 1-0.<br>
</p>
<p>
Two minutes later things went badly wrong when Maidenhead scored again to make it 2-0.<br>
</p>
<p>
When winger Bryce Hosannah was shown a straight red card to reduce Wrexham to 10 men it appeared it was a nightmare visit for the owners but like all good Hollywood movies there was plenty of drama to come.<br>
</p>
<p>
Even with one player less Wrexham were keen to impress the actors in the stands and star striker Paul Mullin reduced the deficit to make it 2-1 before half-time.<br>
</p>
<p>
When the game restarted in the second half local Wrexham hero Jordan Davies made it 2-2 with a stunning goal from 25 yards out and the owners were seen high-fiving in delight.<br>
</p>
<p>
Both sides continued to throw everything at it but it was heartache for Reynolds and McElhenney when Josh Kelly sealed victory for Maidenhead when he made it 3-2.<br>
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, Reynolds wrote on Instagram: 'Football is a beautiful, heartbreaking, soul-deadening, evil and gorgeous game and I'm never sleeping again.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Manager Phil Parkinson said after the loss:'They flew in today and they were trying to keep a low profile but I imagine it's fairly difficult to be low profile and they let us get on with it.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We look forward to meeting them later in the week.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I'm really disappointed for them that we haven't been able to come away with at least a draw. But that's football. It can be a brutal industry.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Many expected that match to be Saturday's visit from Torquay United but they pulled a surprise by turning up at Maidenhead's York Road stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
Reynolds and McElhenney have been determined to make their first visit together, rather than individually, but due to their schedules it proved difficult.<br>
</p>
<p>
Travel plans from the United States and Canada thwarted a previous attempt last season.<br>
</p>
<p>
But with Reynolds last week announcing he is taking a sabbatical following conclusion of filming upcoming Christmas film Spirited, and McElhenney finished with season 15 of his show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, a gap appeared for them to visit on Tuesday night.<br>
</p>
<p>
It has been a mixed start to the season for Wrexham, managed by former Bolton and Sunderland boss Phil Parkinson, as they sit 11th, 13 adrift of league leaders Grimsby Town.<br>
</p>
<p>
Reynolds and McElhenney sealed their takeover of the National League side back in February, purchasing it from the Wrexham Supporters' Trust.<br>
</p>
<p>
They immediately invested 2million into the club and their profile as co-chairmen has seen sponsors including TikTok and Expedia brought in as official partners.<br>
</p>
<p>
Asked why he got involved, Reynolds told The Telegraph:'I am proud to say it was never a joke.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We take the growing and building of both Wrexham AFC and Wrexham the community very seriously.<br>
</p>
<p>
'In a town like Wrexham, if the football club is going to do very well, the community has to do very well.'<br>

Barcelona 'dream of hiring Jurgen Klopp as their manager but have little optimism they can lure him from Liverpool' with his contract at Anfield running until 2024</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/00/49677571-0-image-m-15_1635290707118.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
Barcelona are running out of patience with under-fire manager Ronald Koeman</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Reports in Spain claim it is a matter of when, not if, the Dutchman is sacked</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The Catalans reportedly dream of hiring Jurgen Klopp but know it is unrealistic</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Klopp has a Liverpool deal until 2024 and will take a year-long break afterwards</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Barcelona are dreaming of hiring Jurgen Klopp as their manager but are not very optimistic about their chances of bringing the Liverpool boss to the Camp Nou, say reports.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Catalans are currently in a poor run of form under current boss Ronald Koeman and currently sit ninth in LaLiga, with recent reports in Spain suggesting that it is a matter if when, not if, the Dutchman is sacked from his post.<br>
</p>
<p>
Potential managers that Barcelona president Joan Laporta could bring in next range from younger options such as Xavi Hernandez and Andrea Pirlo, to more experienced candidates such as Roberto Martinez and Erik ten Hag.<br>
</p>
<p>
But according to Spanish news outlet SPORT, Barcelona ideally see Klopp as the ideal person to hold the managerial reigns in Catalonia, but even the LaLiga giants know those chances are slim.<br>
</p>
<p>
Klopp has a contract at Liverpool that runs until 2024, with the German coach revealing his desire to honour that deal - but not extend it - back in August 2020.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 54-year-old manager then wants to take a year-long break from coaching before deciding what he wants to do next after 12 months - with retirement from the game an option on the table.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I'll take a year off and ask myself if I miss football,' Klopp told Sport Buzzer last year when asked about his plans post-2024. 'If I say no, then that will be the end of coach Jurgen Klopp.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Klopp has revolutionised Liverpool's fortunes since taking over as manager in 2015, taking them from the middle of the Premier League table to one of the best sides in Europe.<br>
</p>
<p>
The German led Liverpool to the Champions League title in 2019, having taken them to the final of that competition the year before, and then won the Reds' first Premier League title in 30 years in the following season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Klopp's Liverpool are in the mix for the Premier League title again this season and are unbeaten in their first nine top-flight matches so far this season, but sit a point behind leaders Chelsea.<br>
</p>
<p>
Barcelona, meanwhile, have not won the Champions League title - or even reached the final of the competition - in six years, a feat Klopp has managed three times in the past eight years.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Catalans have also gone two seasons without a title and lost their captain and talisman, Lionel Messi, on a free transfer to PSG due to financial troubles at the club.<br>

Thomas Tuchel delights in Chelsea's shootout win over Southampton as German praises squad for battling through after last-minute changes threatened to scupper the Blues</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/00/49677977-0-image-m-30_1635291988470.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
Thomas Tuchel has delighted in Chelsea's progression in the Carabao Cup</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The Blues advanced to the quarter finals after beating Southampton on penalties</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Tuchel revealed that his Chelsea side suffered last-minute changes on Tuesday</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The German was pleased with his side's performance to see off the Saints</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Thomas Tuchel was pleased Chelsea were able to overcome some last-minute changes to team selection to edge past Southampton following another penalty shoot-out in the Carabao Cup.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Blues required spot-kicks to see off Aston Villa in the previous round at Stamford Bridge and it was the case again in the last-16 after Che Adams' tap-in cancelled out Kai Havertz's 44th-minute opener.<br>
</p>
<p>
Both sides had chances to grab a second but penalties were required and although Mason Mount was denied from 12 yards by Fraser Forster, Theo Walcott and Will Smallbone fired off target for Saints to ensure Chelsea progressed by a 4-3 score.<br>
</p>
<p>
After Tuchel saw Cesar Azpilicueta, Andreas Christensen and Ruben Loftus-Cheek ruled out a day before the fourth-round tie, he was happy to reach the quarter-finals.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We had some last-minute changes because three potential starters got injured in training so it was not planned like this and not so many options from the bench,' he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We knew it was the first time we played together like this and things would be tough against a team who put so much pressure on you like Southampton and that was the way it was.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It was a nice match of football, good performances by both teams and a tough match but in the end we win with a penalty shoot-out.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Tuchel expects Azpilicueta (shoulder) to be fit to face Newcastle at the weekend while Christensen is set to return to training on Thursday following surgery on his tooth.<br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Loftus-Cheek reported some discomfort in his hip on Monday which meant Saul and Ross Barkley got the nod but it was Havertz who grabbed the opener a minute before half-time having failed to net in the 7-0 thrashing of Norwich.<br>
</p>
<p>
The German had seen one earlier effort whizz past the post before another was tipped over by Forster but his header from Barkley's corner in the 44th minute found the net to take him up to three goals this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Southampton responded straight after the break when Adams tapped home after Kyle Walker-Peters had been denied and despite late pressure from the visitors, it went to penalties where Chelsea came out on top to secure a place in the last eight.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tuchel added: 'Every competition is an important competition. We don't want to judge what is more or less important.<br>
</p>
<p>
'When you go out and wear the shirt and prepare matches we play all in. No matter what competition because this is what the club is all about and what the players want.<br>
</p>
<p>
'There is no judging. Players get their chance and used it. The problem is we have another match now in December which is pretty full.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl made nine changes from the weekend draw at Burnley and praised his players.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It was a superb intense game and we had five subs which was perfect. It gave us the chance to get to penalties,' he insisted.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We have done everything we could today and it was a fantastic game to watch for everybody in the stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It was a thriller and a typical cup tie. We wanted to give them a tough evening and we did, I think. It is a pity we couldn't take the win but I am very proud of my team. Everyone did a fantastic job.'<br>

Borussia Dortmund 'eyeing a swoop for Jude Bellingham's 16-year-old younger brother Jobe' two years on from splashing out 30m to land Three Lions star from Birmingham City</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/10/27/00/49677113-0-image-m-160_1635289671698.jpg"/img></center>
<ul><li><b>
Borussia Dortmund are reportedly lining up a move for Jobe Bellingham, 16</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
The Birmingham City starlet is the younger brother of Dortmund star Jude, 18</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
According to The Sun, Dortmund are looking to bring Jobe to Germany as well</b>
</li><br>
<li><b>
Jude has flourished in the Bundesliga and is a regular England international</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
Borussia Dortmund are reportedly lining up a swoop for Jude Bellingham's younger brother, Jobe, 16, from Birmingham City.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jude, 18, made the move from St Andrews to Dortmund two years ago, snubbing Manchester United to seal a 30million switch to the Bundesliga outfit.<br>
</p>
<p>
The England international has since gone from strength to strength, and was part of Gareth Southgate's Three Lions squad for last summer's Euro 2020 campaign.<br>
</p>
<p>
And according to The Sun, the Germans are increasingly keen on landing Jude's younger brother Jobe, who is also making a name for himself with the West Midlands club.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jobe nearly broke his brother's record of becoming the Championship outfit's youngest ever player earlier this season, but was an unused substitute inEFL Cup ties against Colchester and Fulham.<br>
</p>
<p>
He is yet to make his first appearance for Lee Bowyer's side, but Dortmund are understood to have held an interest in Jobe since he was 14, when the club first opened talks regarding Jude's availability.<br>

Jude is enjoying a superb campaign with Dortmund this season, where boss Marco Rose has described his midfielder as 'near perfect'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 18-year-old scored a sensational solo effort against Arminia on Saturday, with Dortmund hoping to hoping to keep in touch with Bayern Munich in the title race despite reeling from the absence of Erling Haaland.<br>

The Norwegian has suffered an injury to his hip flexor and Rose confirmed that the marksman will be sidelined for 'a few weeks'.<br>

<h2>
Cole Palmer is coming of age at Manchester City and counts on Raheem Sterling as a mentor... He's now ready to be the next star moulded into Pep Guardiola's team</h2>

</li><br>
<li><b>
City nearly dropped Palmer from their academy but big things are coming</b>
</li><br>
</ul>
<p>
There is a lovely photograph from the Jan Breydel Stadium last week, snapped as Cole Palmer bounced away towards Manchester City's support in Bruges with Raheem Sterling in tow.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sterling's arms were outstretched, his grin somehow wider, after watching the 19-year-old confidently push the cutback ahead of him and then curl home from the box's edge for a maiden Champions League goal. Trademark Palmer, the sort of finish that those who follow City's academy teams have seen countless times before.<br>
</p>
<p>
On the biggest stage, here was a picture that perfectly captured one description of Palmer's rise by a City source. 'You can see the other players now looking at Cole and going, "right, WOW." Nothing is fazing him,' they said.<br>
</p>
<p>
Rodri is seen beaming in the background and the majority of Pep Guardiola's team rushed to mob their newest prodigious talent. Palmer, a wiry forward whose brain has always compensated for his slight frame, counts Sterling as a major help during his settling in period and it was heartening to witness a seasoned professional going through their own stuff react so positively.<br>
</p>
<p>
Palmer, whose YouTube showreel is awash with the audacious from the right wing or inside, has been around Guardiola's group since Project Restart. The senior coaching staff are enthused about a raft of youngsters coming through but Palmer shone from the off.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He is the next star,' said one only a few weeks on from his introduction into training. He was handed a European debut in Marseille soon after.<br>
</p>
<p>
Looking at him flourish among some of the best players in Europe, under arguably the continent's most innovative manager, it is hard to imagine anything other than this being an obvious trajectory.<br>
</p>
<p>
Particularly when seeing him wander from the halfway line and passing into the corner for a first-ever professional goal during EFL Cup victory over Wycombe Wanderers last month, with Palmer set for more minutes in the competition at West Ham tonight.<br>
</p>
<p>
This, though, has been no straight road for a teenager born in Wythenshawe, 11 miles from Phil Foden, and who joined City from NJ Wythenshawe aged eight. Had it not been for academy director Jason Wilcox, City may have parted ways with him three years ago.<br>
</p>
<p>
Even though he had stood out as City beat Derby County to win the Floodlit Cup - scoring two 'special' goals in the final - there was a split camp during conversations between coaches and the academy's hierarchy over whether he was worthy of a scholarship, the gateway to professional football.<br>
</p>
<p>
At that point, Palmer was underdeveloped and in danger of his peers racing ahead, while City continued to make signings in his position. Wilcox saw something, however, and is said to have 'put his neck on the line' to effectively veto any decision, a show of faith that has been vindicated.<br>
</p>
<p>
Still, Palmer's deal was not in line with others of the same age - both in length and finance. With those terms, the youngster was basically told to prove his doubters wrong.<br>
</p>
<p>
City quickly progress their best talents to the Under 23s, and that team is regularly one of the youngest in Premier League 2, but Wilcox made the decision to hold him back with the Under 18s, where Palmer often operated in an unfamiliar false nine role.<br>
</p>
<p>
Some at the club might have wavered on what heights he could scale yet the same could not be said for a player packed with self-belief and his parents, Jermaine and Marie.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jermaine has been steadfast in the belief that his son was destined for the top and surprise at this season's exploits is not matched within the close family unit. Jermaine spent hours on the park perfecting moves that Palmer then replicated at grassroots level to astonishment and bafflement by his coaches.<br>
</p>
<p>
A grander platform now. Across seven different competitions for club and country this term, Palmer is averaging a goal every 88 minutes. Add in his assists and it is a goal contribution every 64 minutes.<br>
</p>
<p>
They have range from the Champions League to a hat-trick for City's Under 23s, coming on the same day as Guardiola threw him on as a late substitute against Burnley.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Rodolfo (Borrell, Guardiola's assistant) told me that if Cole plays less than 20-25 minutes for us, he is allowed to play in both games,' Guardiola said. 'Training with us is nice, but they have to play. When you are just training and not playing, it's not good for him.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Guardiola praised Palmer's attitude when dropping down a level and he was a cut above on the night - much as he has been for England's Under 21s since Lee Carsley handed him a debut last month.<br>
</p>
<p>
Palmer only started the first match of Carsley's reign against Kosovo by virtue of Emile Smith-Rowe's absence through illness but soon drew gasps from the Milton Keynes crowd when Cruyff-turning a defender to score.<br>
</p>
<p>
It is noticeable that Carsley's team now look to Palmer at every given opportunity despite his relative inexperience among a group stacked with Premier League appearances.<br>
</p>
<p>
Carsley knows all about him from his time at City, while England coach Ian Foster played a similar national role to Wilcox's at club level. Foster constantly championed his cause - picking him in younger age groups ahead of bigger names - and, when they were graded by the FA at St George's Park, Palmer was categorised as a potential senior player.<br>
</p>
<p>
That is all this is at the moment: potential. Guardiola has called for patience, although quite how long that lasts is debatable, and that City refused all loan interest last summer tells its own story. Now he must trust that they integrate him in similar fashion to Foden.<br>
</p>
<p>
It certainly bodes well that, on signing his first big five-year contract in June, sporting director Txiki Begiristain took Palmer to one side and made him realise this was the ultimate sign that he is deemed a first-team player.<br>
</p>
<p>
Begiristain takes the responsibility of moulding another local lad into a first-team regular exceptionally seriously.<br>
</p>
<p>
This one, like the other one, appears the archetypal Guardiola player.<br>
