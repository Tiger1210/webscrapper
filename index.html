<h2>
Arsenal had no energy, no fight and no ideas in their dismal Brentford loss... and Gunners legend MARTIN KEOWN fears Mikel Arteta's job is already on the line ahead of crunch Chelsea clash</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/17/46911943-0-image-a-41_1629477595815.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
After the humiliation of losing 2-0 at Brentford in their first game, some have wondered if this might be a long season for Arsenal. But if they cannot turn around their fortunes soon, it could end up being a very short one for manager Mikel Arteta.<br>
</p>
<p>
His task is not about to get any easier. Before the first international break, Arsenal face Chelsea at home on Sunday and Manchester City away next weekend, after which they could very well be bottom of the league with three defeats from three.<br>
</p>
<p>
It is a results business and I think the Chelsea game will be judgment day for Arteta. There will be a packed house at the Emirates for the first time since his early days in charge, and fans will be expecting to see evidence of what the Spaniard has achieved since they were last there.<br>
</p>
<p>
In the 20 months since he took over from Unai Emery, Arteta has won two trophies — the FA Cup and Community Shield — and lots of players have come and gone. So why does it feel like nothing has changed?<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal had momentum coming into this campaign. They won their final five league games of last season and, despite finishing eighth, were six points off the top four. Only four of their players went to the Euros, so Arteta had the whole pre-season to work with the majority of the squad. They should have been hitting top gear earlier than most teams — then they were second-best to Brentford.<br>
</p>
<p>
There was a fear in the air last week, and Arsenal’s sideways passing was a trigger for the hosts to press, forcing the Gunners to go back to the goalkeeper too often. Brentford repeatedly went long to Ivan Toney, but Arsenal defended naively. <br>
</p>
<p>
They were 20 yards too deep and lost the aerial battle time and again. In my Arsenal team, Patrick Vieira would have stepped back, sat in front of a player such as Toney and provided cover, but where was the midfield help at Griffin Park?<br>
</p>
<p>
The energy was missing, and so was the fight. For Brentford’s second goal, goalkeeper Bernd Leno was being held by Pontus Jansson, and was unable to come out to claim the long throw. Christian Norgaard powered in to head home the loose ball and afterwards Arteta said there was not much they could do about Leno being held. Wasn’t there? You have to have a defender in between Leno and the forward, and if needed — as Jens Lehmann was an expert at — the goalkeeper can throw himself to the floor to attract the referee’s attention.<br>
</p>
<p>
There has been a huge turnover in the Arsenal squad since Arteta took over and it has contributed to the instability of the club. Look at the players who have come in during his tenure. <br>
</p>
<p>
They have had nothing from Willian, Pablo Mari feels like a fill-in centre half rather than a No1, Cedric Soares is a squad player. Thomas Partey shows good qualities but has had injury problems and while Gabriel Magalhaes is a player I like, he could have done with more support. <br>
</p>
<p>
He let himself down in a few games last season and they dropped him rather than offer him encouragement. All the while, Lucas Torreira and William Saliba have never been given the opportunities.<br>
</p>
<p>
The recruitment under Arteta and technical director Edu has been hit and miss, which is a concern, particularly as it will be crucial going forward. There have also been a number of red flags, namely selling Emiliano Martinez, now Argentina’s No1, for £20million and replacing him with the inexperienced Runar Alex Runarsson. <br>
</p>
<p>
That error has been compounded this summer with the signing of Sheffield United’s Aaron Ramsdale. With finite resources at its disposal, the club cannot afford to be that slack with its money.<br>
</p>
<p>
Another area of concern is the club’s inability to shift its dead wood, a strategy at the centre of its seemingly ill-fated summer overhaul. Instead, the club has sold Joe Willock, an exciting young goal-scoring midfielder, to Newcastle. <br>
</p>
<p>
I will not be alone in being able to name at least 10 players I would rather see sold than Willock. With that deal now done, it becomes imperative that Arsenal use that money wisely, but the evidence so far does not inspire me with confidence.<br>
</p>
<p>
I know many Arsenal fans may not agree, but there have been so many ins and outs at the club that it does not feel stable any more. Granit Xhaka, who has just signed a new contract, is one of the few characters in the dressing room who might make a stand by speaking up when performances are as poor as they were last week. He has standing among the squad and keeping him around will help create stability, though a period of good results would be even better.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arteta inherited this group from Emery and has been trying to get rid of any issues within it, but he may have created one himself with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang last season — calling out his captain when he was late to the Tottenham home game in March. It is proving a real test of his man-management skills, but one he may need to pass to get the team firing again.<br>
</p>
<p>
This is the most important month of Arteta’s managerial career, and it is time for the team to produce if he is to stay in the job until the end of the season. There are no more excuses, it is time to perform.<br>

<h2>
Harry Kane FINALLY returns to Tottenham training with wantaway club captain pictured back on the pitch with teammates after extended absence amid Manchester City interest </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/18/46913937-0-image-a-6_1629481253793.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Harry Kane has been pictured in Tottenham training for the first time this season as he continues to push for a move to Premier League champions Manchester City.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The club's star forward has not played for the team under new boss Nuno Espirito Santo after returning from a holiday in the Bahamas and Florida and has faced scrutiny over claims he refused to return from training amid links to Pep Guardiola's side. <br>
</p>
<p>
Kane though has now been pictured in training alongside his teammates for the first time, with the England captain seen next to defender Sergio Reguilon. <br>
</p>
<p>
Kane clarified there was a breakdown in communication which led to him not showing up in training and he was also not selected in the matchday squad to face the Premier League champions in the opening day clash - which Spurs won 1-0.<br>
</p>
<p>
He underwent some training ground work on his own on Monday while his team-mates recovered from their 1-0 victory over Pep Guardiola's champions.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tottenham then left the striker at home for their Europa League Conference defeat to Portuguese side Pacos de Ferreira.<br>
</p>
<p>
It is hoped the 28-year-old will be fit to feature in their clash against Wolves on Sunday but a decision will be made at the weekend.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ahead of Tottenham's trip to Portugal, Nuno said:  'What we must be sure of is that when we decide to put a player on the pitch we have to consider all the aspects.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The fitness aspects, mental aspects and we are here to support all the players, equally and Harry of course has all our support.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail revealed earlier this week  that the England captain feels chairman Daniel Levy has broken a promise to allow him to leave the club this summer amid increasing tensions between the pair. <br>
</p>
<p>
Sources close to the 28-year-old claim he feels Spurs have not matched his lofty ambitions, though he will continue to give us all when called upon to rebuild his trust with the supporters.<br>
</p>
<p>
He still has his heart set on a move to Manchester City - who have already made a bid of £125million for his signature. Spurs are sticking to their valuation of £150m for a player regarded as one of the best forwards in the world, though City are unwilling to match their asking price.<br>
</p>
<p>
City do plan to make an improved bid before the end of the transfer window, but Pep Guardiola's side do not want to drag out the chase into next summer.<br>

LIVE: Paris Saint-Germain travel to Brest without Lionel Messi and Sergio Ramos as they look to make it three wins out of three in Ligue 1 this season after wins over Troyes and Strasbourg </h2>

<p>
With Lionel Messi still not ready to start, Paris Saint-Germain will be hoping to making three wins out of three in Ligue 1 this term when they travel to Brest on Friday night. <br>
</p>
<p>
Mauricio Pochettino's men won 2-1 at Troyes before playing at the Parc des Princes last weekend in their first competitive match at home this term, beating Strasbourg 4-2, with Mauro Icardi, Julian Draxler and Pablo Sarabia among the scorers. <br>
</p>
<p>
Pochettino will be targeting a clean sheet this evening against a side who have drawn their first two games 1-1 against Lyon and Rennes, although like with Messi, the game comes too soon for fellow statement signing Sergio Ramos, who is likely to first appear after September's international break, according to AS.<br>

<h2>
Martin Odegaard fires out at the Spanish press after being branded 'a failure' following his £30m Arsenal move, claiming 'almost everything being said is untrue' and that he 'lived a dream' at Real Madrid before heading to England</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/17/46910567-0-image-a-4_1629475634068.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Martin Odegaard has slammed sections of the Spanish media for writing misleading stories about his time at Real Madrid following his £30million move to Arsenal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Over six years after signing for Madrid when he had barely turned 16 years old, Odegaard severed ties with the club on Friday by sealing a permanent move to Arsenal following last season's loan spell at the Emirates Stadium. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Norway captain became Real's youngest ever player in May 2015 when he came off the bench to replace Cristiano Ronaldo in a LaLiga game against Getafe and big things were expected of him.<br>
</p>
<p>
But he leaves the club having made only 11 appearances for the first team and there was a sense of regret in the Spanish capital at the midfielder's unfulfilled potential.<br>
</p>
<p>
Newspaper Marca, which has close ties to Real and president Florentino Perez, penned a disparaging article about the 22-year-old following his £30 permanent switch to Arsenal, describing him as 'an economic bonanza but a sporting failure'. <br>
</p>
<p>
But Odegaard fired back at the Spanish media on Friday, hours after his move back to the Gunners had been officially confirmed.<br>
</p>
<p>
In a post on Instagram, the Norwegian showed his gratitude to Real and said he "completed a dream" by moving to the Santiago Bernabeu and "got the opportunity to learn from the best in the world and my idols".<br>
</p>
<p>
But he then hit out at the media treatment of him.  <br>
</p>
<p>
'These days a lot has been said about me and my motivations for leaving. I only want to say that almost everything that is being said is not true,' he wrote.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It’s a real shame that the press say things that aren’t true, because many people sincerely think that’s how it is.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I have my reasons, I know what the truth is and what happened and that’s why I think this (leaving Madrid) is for the best.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The Marca article had described Odegaard as 'the dark side' of Real's long-running policy of signing talented youngsters on low transfer fees with a view to the future.<br>
</p>
<p>
Marco Asensio, Raphael Varane and Casemiro are the biggest success stories of this policy and all went on to have great careers with the club and win multiple trophies.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Odegaard is one of the less successful exponents along with Dani Ceballos and Theo Hernandez.<br>
</p>
<p>
'On an economic level there's no doubt that the Norwegian has proved profitable. He arrived for four million euros and leaves for close to 40. But that wasn't Madrid's goal when they prised from Stromsgodset the player that all of Europe wanted,' said the Marca article.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Many youngsters have arrived and what's clear is that making a name for yourself at Real Madrid is something only a select chosen few are capable of doing. Odegaard barely entered in the fight to be an important Real Madrid player. Others are still fighting to do so while others have left, some of whom will return and some who will not.' <br>
</p>
<p>
'More than six and a half years ago I signed for Real Madrid and fulfilled a huge dream in being able to wear the white shirt, play at the Santiago Bernabeu and play in the Champions League. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I couldn’t be more proud. I came here aged 16 and I had the opportunity to learn from the best in the world and my idols. I’ve learned a lot and enjoyed myself along the way. I’m grateful to everything that happened to me and everything I’ve learned.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘I want to thank all the people who’ve helped me improve and grow at Real Madrid, be they coaches, teammates, physios, club employees and fans. Thank you!<br>
</p>
<p>
‘I’ve been through some good moments and some bad ones, as happens often in life and in football. I’ve become much stronger and more prepared for the future.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘These days a lot has been said about me and my motivations for leaving. I only want to say that almost everything that is being said is not true. It’s a real shame that the press say things that aren’t true, because many people sincerely think that’s how it is.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘I have my reasons, I know what the truth is and what happened and that’s why I think this leaving is for the best.’<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Real won the race to sign Odegaard in January 2015 after he gained global attention for becoming Norway's youngest ever international player.<br>
</p>
<p>
He began life in Real's reserve side Castilla but in a rare move was allowed to train with the first team, with coaches believing he would progress faster by working every day alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Luka Modric.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Odegaard's special status at the club annoyed several people at the club, not least his Castilla teammates, and it gave rise to the sense the player was being fast-tracked into the first team before he had earned his place.<br>
</p>
<p>
After two years with Castilla and a single Copa del Rey appearance to go with the LaLiga cameo against Getafe, he was shipped off to Dutch top-flight side Heerenveen for two campaigns.<br>
</p>
<p>
He then switched to fellow Eredivisie side Vitesse Arnhem before returning to Spain in 2019 to join Real Sociedad.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sociedad soon proved to be an ideal platform for Odegaard to really excel and he described the Basque side as 'the perfect project for me' during a sensational start to the season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Odegaard starred in a 2-0 win over Atletico Madrid and then reminded his parent club just how good he was with a superb performance and goal in a 4-3 Copa del Rey win at the Santiago Bernabeu. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Norwegian was one of Sociedad's top performers as they made a real push for Champions League football before eventually finishing sixth and reached the Copa del Rey final, which was then postponed by a year due to Covid.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Odegaard was unexpectedly recalled to Madrid a year earlier than expected and despite being given a few starting berths from coach Zinedine Zidane, his appearances soon dried up and he opted to move to Arsenal to get more first team opportunities and ensure his precocious talent did not go to waste. <br>

<h2>
David de Gea and Bruno Fernandes left in fits of laughter after sharing a joke, with Manchester United players in high spirits as they head out for a light-hearted lunch in Cheshire ahead of their trip to Southampton</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/18/46912843-0-image-a-30_1629479056962.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Manchester United's players are unsurprisingly in high spirits after their thumping 5-1 opening day victory over Leeds, and a small group of them continued the camaraderie by heading out for lunch on Friday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Bruno Fernandes and David de Gea were pictured enjoying each other's company, with the playmaker even reduced into fits of laughter, after the superstars dined in style at Cibo Restaurant in Hale Village, Cheshire.<br>
</p>
<p>
Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic joined them for the trip out the day before they travel down to Southampton, and nearby onlookers appeared amused as the party joked around while they left the building and parted ways.<br>
</p>
<p>
On their website, Cibo describe themselves as being a 'modern day, classic Italian restaurant', and serve hand-made pasta, pizzas, seafood and meat dishes using what they call 'only the finest ingredients'. <br>
</p>
<p>
And it appeared that the United players were left impressed by the occasion. Mata and Fernandes looked to share a joke while they walked away, while goalkeeper De Gea, within ear shot behind them, also let out a laugh.<br>
</p>
<p>
Matic, meanwhile, gave his long-standing team-mate De Gea a fist bump as the group split up on the pavement, while the other three carried on. It was then, as they crossed the road, that De Gea and Fernandes continued to josh about.<br>
</p>
<p>
With some welcome free time under their belts, their attention will now turn to helping United pick up a second-straight Premier League win to begin the season. On Sunday, a typically tricky trip to St Mary's is up next. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the clash, boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gave reporters an update on Paul Pogba's uncertain contract situation, and also stressed that Jesse Lingard still has a role to play for United during this campaign. <br>
</p>
<p>
Both players are known to be incredibly popular figures in the dressing room, as well as close friends, and their exits this summer may hit the team spirit, as well as any potential title challenge, at Old Trafford. <br>
</p>
<p>
Pogba has just over 10 months left on his £290,000-a-week deal, and appears set to walk away from the club as a free agent for a second time. United are desperate for him to pen an extension, but he has shown little interest as of yet.<br>
</p>
<p>
Having dazzled with four assists in the 5-1 victory against Leeds last weekend, Pogba was thrust back into the headlines, but Solskjaer is adamant that his focus is fully on keeping the midfielder happy on a day-to-day basis.<br>
</p>
<p>
Quizzed on Pogba's situation, Solskjaer said: 'Well, that's negotiations with Paul's representatives and the club. For me and Paul, we work together every day here and we keep on trying to improve, improve the team and to enjoy ourselves. <br>
</p>
<p>
'When you win games, you enjoy yourselves more.'<br>
</p>
<p>
And on the possibility of Lingard staying at the club, he added: 'I think Jesse's first priority is to get into our team. I think whenever your employer is Man United, that's your first priority. It always is and we can have great moments together.<br>
</p>
<p>
'As a manager with players and a squad like I've got now, it's difficult to say they're not playing because, of course, I've got to leave players out never mind from the starting XI but from the squad.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But they all have to remember and know they're going to have to play a part if we're to be successful.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Jesse is back to his fitness. He's played really well in the behind-closed-doors game (against Burnley) on Tuesday and he's come back bubbly and in good shape. He's got a big part to play.'<br>
</p>

Arsenal complete £30m move for Sheffield United's Aaron Ramsdale with goalkeeper agreeing terms on 'long-term' deal as he provides competition for Bernd Leno</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/19/46915453-0-image-a-4_1629483705023.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Aaron Ramsdale has completed his £30million move from Sheffield United to Arsenal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ramsdale has put pen to paper on a long-term deal at the Emirates and joins up with his new team-mates just a game into the new Premier League campaign.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 23-year-old has been a target for boss Mikel Arteta throughout the summer and the Spaniard has finally been granted his wish after bringing in a new goalkeeper to compete with current No 1 Bernd Leno.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail understands the initial transfer fee is around £24m with £6m to be paid in add-ons depending on if he eventually forces Leno out of the first team.<br>
</p>
<p>
Confirming that Ramsdale has left for north London, Sheffield United confirmed that an offer was accepted and labelled it as 'head-turning'. The stopper himself also 'highlighted his desire to further his career'.<br>
</p>
<p>
They also revealed, as was reported by Sportsmail, that a number of bids from Arsenal were rebuffed before an agreement was reached. <br>
</p>
<p>
Blades manager Slavisa Jokanovic didn't select Ramsdale for his side's Championship clash with West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday night, saying he was 'simply not in the right state of mind' to play. <br>
</p>
<p>
'We felt he was not ready for the game,' Blades boss Jokanovic told Sky Sports. 'We took the decision not to use him for the game.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He's simply not in the right state of the mind. We prefer not to complicate things and start with Mike (Verrips).'<br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking after United's 4-0 defeat by West Brom, Jokanovic added: 'The deal is not complete but it's agreed between the clubs. I believe the agreement is close to being done but it can be soon. <br>
</p>
<p>
'It's not really what I want but it's difficult to stop this kind of situation. It's a huge deal for the club.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal have opted for a British-based goalkeeper to join the club after initially looking at Ajax's Andre Onana, with Ramsdale and West Brom's Sam Johnstone both heavily linked.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Gunners have already seen two bids for the Englishman rejected, and will hope that this is a case of third time lucky as Mikel Arteta looks to strengthen his squad before the window shuts.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal started the season poorly on Friday night in the Premier League's opening game after they were beaten 2-0 at new boys Brentford.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Gunners faced heavy criticism for their defending during the encounter, in particular the second goal where Leno and his defenders allowed the ball to bounce in the six-yard box from a throw-in before conceding.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jamie Carragher labelled Arsenal's performance 'weak', opining that the top-flight newcomers 'bullied' their more established rivals at the Brentford Community Stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
'How do you describe Arsenal's defending here? It's just Arsenal. Weak, bullied, men against boys again. New season same old story,' he said on commentary duty for Sky Sports.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Spurs have it that people say it's "Spursy". I think it's about time Arsenal have something like that as well. Because this is just an Arsenal performance. Everyone knows what that means; an Arsenal performance.'<br>
</p>
<p>
But Arsenal have now moved and also look set to add Martin Odegaard to the list of summer arrivals that already includes Ben White, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Nuno Tavares.<br>

Romelu Lukaku will be unleashed for his second Chelsea debut against Arsenal on Sunday, confirms Thomas Tuchel... as Blues boss predicts Gunners will 'play the underdog role' in London derby</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/15/46905141-0-image-a-48_1629468067061.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Thomas Tuchel has paved the way for Romelu Lukaku to make his second Chelsea debut against Arsenal on Sunday and backed the £97.5million signing to be the final piece in his jigsaw.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lukaku has returned to Stamford Bridge after seven years following spells with Everton, Manchester United and Inter Milan, the club he left to return to the English game.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘We are hoping he is on the pitch on Sunday,’ said Tuchel. ‘We hope he is [the missing piece in the puzzle] but at the same time we try to find solutions for any questions we are asked during the games.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘We still want to be a strong squad. Romelu is the kind of personality and profile we were missing up front and from now it’s our job to push ourselves to the limit.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘Romelu is unique. He can play with his back to goal but also he is at his strongest in transition, with his immense speed. Add to that the fact he is a true goalscorer so he is unique – a new experience for me.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘Of course we expect goals and he expects that too. He has delivered goals wherever he has been and we will see how far his impact goes.’<br>
</p>
<p>
Tuchel also expects Arsenal to behave as underdogs to try to gain an edge in the London derby fixture at Emirates Stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Gunners endured a desperate opening weekend to the Premier League season, first suffering a coronavirus outbreak within the squad and then losing 2-0 at newly-promoted Brentford, with Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta expressing surprise on Friday that the game had not been postponed.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tuchel said: ‘When I put myself in their shoes, they can play the underdog role. They’ve had complications with Covid-19 and difficulties in their first match.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘So they will try to put themselves in the role of underdog which is fair enough. It’s up to us to be focused and we are well aware of everything they will ask of us.’ <br>

<h2>
EXCLUSIVE: Tony Cottee backs PAI Capital's bid to take over West Ham as he is 'confident they will deliver on all fronts'... throwing weight behind the bid just days after Rio Ferdinand </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/16/46908895-0-image-m-81_1629474166675.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Tony Cottee is the latest West Ham hero to offer his backing to PAI Capital’s takeover attempt.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail revealed the consortium’s bid to buy the Hammers last month and Rio and Anton Ferdinand have already thrown their weight behind the plans.<br>
</p>
<p>
And now former striker Cottee has supported the takeover plan, which involves former QPR chief executive Phil Beard.<br>
</p>
<p>
Cottee, who scored 146 goals in 336 appearances for the club, said: ‘I’ve been following the bid closely and have had detailed discussions with the PAI team recently. Having got to know the people involved and having had the opportunity to learn more about their plans, I’m pleased to announce that I’m fully behind PAI bid.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘Everyone knows how much this club means to me. I want the best for the West Ham players, the staff and the fans, and I’m confident that PAI will deliver on all fronts.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘We’ve spoken at length about what is needed - those discussions have included Rio, Anton and the rest of the bidding team - and we are all on the same page about what can be done. <br>
</p>
<p>
'There is a real passion from everyone involved, and a confidence that we can reach the goals we have set out to achieve - the first one, of course, is getting the fans to believe in this bid. We want the fans to support this, and I’m hoping that I can help with that conversation.’<br>
</p>
<p>
Cottee’s addition to the PAI Capital bid comes as they are set to put forward a further offer to the club to acquire a controlling stake.<br>
</p>
<p>
As PAI announced last week that terms have been agreed with the LLDC to take over the London Stadium, so their offer to West Ham majority shareholder David Sullivan seeks to unite the Club with its ground for the first time since it vacated the Boleyn Ground in 2016.<br>

Rangers pull U-turn to BAR Celtic fans from Old Firm clash at Ibrox next weekend as hosts blame Hoops for failing to guarantee their fans would be let in for Parkhead return fixture</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/18/46914029-0-image-m-35_1629481437608.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Celtic supporters have been shut-out of the first Old Firm derby of the season, with Rangers turning the blame on their rivals for the late breakdown.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Glasgow rivals are set to face-off at Ibrox next Sunday in the fourth game of the Scottish Premiership season.   <br>
</p>
<p>
Both sides have three points from two games, setting up a tense affair as Celtic aim to snatch back the title after having their decade of dominance ended last season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ibrox will be free of Celtic supporters next Sunday for the first Old Firm derby of the season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Celtic have already been handed a blow, with Parkhead stunned after their neighbours decided to bar their fans from their face-off, according to the Daily Record.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Rangers had printed and sent-off 700 away tickets for the match, but pulled a U-turn with the Scottish champions reportedly growing frustrated at talks stalling over the return fixture.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Celtic were believed to be intending on allowing Gers fans into Parkhead for the match on January 2, but had yet to provide concrete numbers.   <br>
</p>
<p>
The club must keep sections of their ground sterile for a coronavirus 'Red Zone', which has seen affected home fans moved to other seats.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Rangers wouldn't wait any longer and dropped news of their green and white ban on Friday, to the shock of Celtic chiefs.   <br>
</p>
<p>
Since 2018 the number of travelling fans has been reduced from 7,000 to just 800 to reduce the tension at the historic fixture.  <br>

<h2>
SERIE A PREDICTIONS: Can Simone Inzaghi keep Inter Milan on top or will Juventus under the returning Max Allegri re-establish their dominance? Every team assessed as the champions kick-off the new season</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/13/46903003-0-image-a-47_1629464254539.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
This weekend will see domestic football return to Italy just seven weeks after the men's national team triumphed at the European Championship this summer. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 2021-22 Serie A campaign is set to be one of the most exciting and unpredictable in seasons to date following an influx of new managers and a range of summer transfers.   <br>
</p>
<p>
Inter Milan will kick off the season on Saturday afternoon against Genoa as they look to retain their Serie A title. However, they will have to do so without Achraf Hakimi who moved to Paris Saint-Germain and Romelu Lukaku who joined Chelsea this summer. <br>
</p>
<p>
City rivals and fellow title challengers AC Milan meanwhile will have to make do without Euro 2020 hero Gianluigi Donnarumma after the shot-stopper departed for PSG. <br>
</p>
<p>
Atalanta are, however, one of the only Italian clubs to have benefitted from the summer transfer window, picking up Juan Musso from Udinese and Merih Demiral from Juventus. As a result, they will look to press on from last term's excellent third place finish.<br>
</p>
<p>
Things will also look different for Roma as ex-Nerazzurri boss Jose Mourinho will return to the Italian top-flight to take the reins from former manager Paulo Fonseca.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Portuguese coach will look to wipe the slate clean after a horrid run of form in the Premier League during ill-fated spells at Manchester United and most recently Tottenham Hotspur. However, he will have to stay out of the media and focus on getting results if he is going to reassert his managerial superiority.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Juventus will look to re-establish their dominance and prove that last season was a blip after losing out on the Serie A title for the first time in 10 years to Inter Milan.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail have analysed how each team should fare during the 2021-22 season and identified a number of stars to look out for...<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
Having been hit by injuries and erratic form last season, Andrea Pirlo's side only managed a fourth-place finish in the Italian top-flight - missing out on the title for the first time in 10 years.<br>
</p>
<p>
They suffered disappointing defeats by Crotone, Fiorentina and Verona as Pirlo experimented with tactics in the first half of the season. They did however win the Coppa Italia and Suppercoppa Italiana.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it wasn't enough to save Pirlo - who was sacked in May and replaced by Massimiliano Allegri.<br>
</p>
<p>
Allegri will be in for a tough ride this season as Roma, Inter, Milan, Lazio, Napoli, and Atalanta have all having strengthened their team during the summer transfer window.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, Juventus have signed Manuel Locatelli from Sassuolo and are in the process of bringing Miralem Pjanic in from Barcelona to strengthen their squad ahead of the 2021-2022 season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Cristiano Ronaldo will also get the support he has previously lacked in the attacking third as Paulo Dybala is finally back in the squad following several injuries.    <br>
</p>
<p>
As a result, they will look to reclaim their crown and initiate another period of dominance on the peninsula.<br>
</p>
<p>
Atalanta have exceeded expectations and put Serie A giants in their place over the last couple of years...despite having one of the smallest budgets in the entire league.<br>
</p>
<p>
After being relegated in 2003, 2005 and 2010, Atalanta climbed out of Serie B to claim a place in the Italian top-flight once again. However, they suffered five bottom half finishes before turning their fortunes around.<br>
</p>
<p>
It was Gian Piero Gasperini's arrival at Atalanta in 2016 that transformed the ambitions of the club. During the manager's first season in charge, Atalanta managed a fourth-place finish and claimed a spot on the European stage for the first time in almost 20 years. <br>
</p>
<p>
Now, five years on, Atalanta have cemented a Champions League spot for the third time in a row and established themselves contenders for the Serie A title.<br>
</p>
<p>
Gasperini's tactics, including his adventurous 3-4-3 formation, have been at the forefront of their success over the years. While Atalanta's recruitment team have also played a role in enabling the club to reach the heights expected of them.<br>
</p>
<p>
Atalanta have brought in young, talented players such as Merih Demiral to help the club progress into an influential side over the next few years.<br>
</p>
<p>
Gasperini will be hopeful that the new recruits will help Atalanta retain their title as Serie A’s top scorers with 98 goals from 38 games last season.<br>
</p>
<p>
While Berat Djimsiti, Robin Gosens, Marten de Roon, Remo Freuler, and Duvan Zapata will bring experience to the squad and ground the youngster starlets.<br>
</p>
<p>
Antonio Conte's Inter Milan dominated Serie A last term, winning their 19th title with four games to spare and securing their first 'Scudetto' since their historic treble under Mourinho in 2010.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, it is no secret that things have begun to fall apart this summer with Conte leaving the club by mutual consent and several key players opting to forge their own paths elsewhere.<br>
</p>
<p>
Conte transformed the Nerazzurri into a title-winning side when he joined the club two years ago. During his first season in charge, they finished second in the table before going on to win the title in the following season.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, having fallen out with Inter’s hierarchy, he left the club just three days after they lifted the Serie A title. He was subsequently replaced by former Lazio boss Simone Inzaghi.<br>
</p>
<p>
Inzaghi has a track record of giving younger players a chance - which could be vital for Inter Milan this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Given the fact Lukaku has left for Chelsea and Hakimi has left for PSG, the likes of Martin Satriano and Lucien Agoume could be awarded a more regular place in the Nerazzurri's starting XI. <br>
</p>
<p>
Inter will be eager to retain their title this season but it is unlikely they will be able to do so with what seems to be a weaker squad.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Champions League qualification will be the primary focus for Napoli this season as the Serie A title is just too far out of the reach.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, they will remain with the hunting pack and will look to push the likes of Inter Milan, Juventus and Atalanta. Should either team slip up, Napoli will be ready and waiting to capitalise.<br>
</p>
<p>
Napoli will also be under the tutelage of veteran coach Luciano Spalletti who has returned to the club after a two-year absence. The highly renowned Serie A coach will be eager to better the club's fifth-place finish last season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Spalletti has a history of success in the Italian top-flight, overseeing a highly successful Roma side during the 2004–05 season. He also successfully managed Inter from 2017 to 2019. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, he has not been in a top-flight hot-seat for two years and will be under enormous pressure to land a Champions League place this term. <br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, he should be well equipped to get the job done with the likes of Victor Osimhen, Lorenzo Insigne and Hector Lozano in his squad.<br>
</p>
<p>
Jose Mourinho has returned to the Italian top-flight to take charge of Roma and he will be looking to turn his side into Serie A title winners after two barren decades.<br>
</p>
<p>
Roma won their third and last Scudetto in 2001 and their last trophy in 2008, but if anyone can turn their fortunes around it is ‘the special one’. <br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Mourinho will start his Serie A campaign off with a difficult opening day clash against Fiorentina at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday night. <br>
</p>
<p>
It will be his first competitive game since leaving Tottenham in April and he will be hoping to get off to the perfect start. <br>
</p>
<p>
Mourinho has already had a major impact in the 'Eternal City'. He has signed Tammy Abraham from Chelsea for £34million and proven to be a hit with supporters, who are desperate for success.<br>
</p>
<p>
Not only has Mourinho brought in some exciting new players this summer but he's also tried to build bridges with his existing stars. Henrikh Mkhitaryan insisted he has buried the hatchet with his new boss after friction between the pair when they were both at Manchester United.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Mourinho will also have to manage without Leonardo Spinazzola for the first few months of the season after the achilles problem he suffered at Euro 2020. However, he has told his team to fully focus on their performances so the Italian's absence isn't too harmful.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The 2021-22 season marks AC Milan's return to the UEFA Champions League for the first time in seven years. However, their success on the European stage has been questioned after their performances in Europa League over the last few seasons.<br>
</p>
<p>
One of the major difficulties AC Milan will face this season will be the physical demand on the players. <br>
</p>
<p>
The campaign may be a struggle for the Italian side - who will have a forward line consisting of 39-year-old Zlatan Ibrahimovic and 35-year-old Olivier Giroud.<br>
</p>
<p>
Additionally, their success in the league last season was primarily down to Gianluigi Donnarumma, who has left the club to join PSG. <br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, AC Milan have replaced the shot-stopper with Mike Maignan – who was instrumental in helping Lille become the Ligue 1 champions ahead of PSG.<br>
</p>
<p>
Regardless of goalkeepers, AC Milan’s defensive structure should be sound.  The likes of Simon Kjaer and captain Alessandro Romagnoli will bring in experience, while Fikayo Tomori and Theo Hernandez will bring a young and dynamic element to the squad.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lazio claimed a fourth-place finish in the 2019-20 season, earning a place in the UEFA Champions League for the first time in 13 years. They had hoped to continue such fine form last term but struggled to hit the heights expected of them. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Italian side finished the Serie A season in sixth place after suffering a difficult start to the campaign by losing three of their first four games. However, they turned their form around and secured victories against Bologna and Torino and a draw against Juventus. <br>
</p>
<p>
Looking ahead to the new season, Lazio will be eager to hit the ground running and have taken the right precautions to do so.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Lazio have had an eventful summer, making drastic changes to their team. They have signed right full-back Elseid Hysaj, left-winger Felipe Anderson, left-back Dimitrije Kamenovic, and right-winger Luka Romero.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Lazio are still in need of a central defensive midfielder and right centre-back to round off their squad and push for a top half finish.<br>
</p>
<p>
Hellas Verona finished the Serie A standings in 10th place last season after consistently punching above their weight this season. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, the club had a history of overachieving under Ivan Juric. Therefore, the pressure will be on Eusebio Di Francesco, who has taken over the reins as their new manager. <br>
</p>
<p>
It seems unlikely that Di Francesco will be able to match the result attained by his predecessor, but that won't stop him from trying. <br>
</p>
<p>
Di Francesco has experienced successful spells at Sassuolo and Roma in the past but failed in his most recent roles with Sampdoria and Cagliari. <br>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, Di Francesco will be under a magnifying glass as he guides Hellas Verona through the 2021-2022 season.   <br>
</p>
<p>
Sampdoria finished a respectable ninth under the tutelage of Claudio Ranieri last season. However, they will be managed by Roberto D'Aversa for the 2021-22 campaign. <br>
</p>
<p>
Sampdoria relied heavily on loan signings Antonio Candreva and Keita Balde last season and will continue to do so again. The pair both scored in their first win of the calendar year against Inter Milan. <br>
</p>
<p>
Fabio Quagliarella was also at the forefront of Sampdoria's attack - scoring 13 league goals. He was also supported by Scandinavian starlets Mikkel Damsgaard and Morten Thorsby. <br>
</p>
<p>
Given Sampdoria have managed to keep hold of such players, it seems likely that the club will push on from last season. Antonio Candreva and Ernesto Torregrossa will also look to contribute, having arrived on permanent deals from Inter Milan and Brescia respectively. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, Sampdoria face a difficult start to the campaign, playing four out of last season’s top five by match-day six. <br>
</p>
<p>
Although, if they emerge with 10 points or more from such fixtures, who knows where D'Aversa's side could go.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Sassuolo are set to embark on a life without Roberto de Zerbi at the helm. During the manager's tenure from 2018 to 2021, the club developed an exciting style of football that captured the hearts of fans across the nation.<br>
</p>
<p>
The attractive style in which they played also enticed several Italian talents to the club, with some becoming part of the Azzurri furniture and others being linked with moves to a range of European giants.<br>
</p>
<p>
Although it seems unlikely that the club will win the Serie A title, Sassuolo will be looking for an outside chance of securing European football. Nevertheless, it seems like to too much of a push to put them in that bracket for the 2021-22 season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sassuolo have finished eighth in the Serie A table in the past two seasons. However, they have improved their statistics by upping their overall points tally to 62 last season - finishing level with Roma.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sassuolo also lost their star striker Francesco Caputo to injury last season. Had he not have been ruled out of action, the Neroverdi may have not suffered that November lull that saw them struggle to put together a string of results.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, it is Sassuolo's inability to keep goals out that may see them suffer this season. During the 2019-20 campaign they conceded 32 open play goals - ranking them 10th in the league.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 2020-21 season saw them concede eight more - bringing their tally of goals conceded from open play to 40. Therefore, Sassuolo must look to sure up their defence if they want to succeed this term.<br>
</p>
<p>
The responsibility will fall to right-back Jeremy Toljan and 22-year-old centre-back Ruan from Gremio.<br>
</p>
<p>
Fiorentina have endured a turbulent 12 months, having appointed four different managers over the course of a year. As a result, it will be owner Rocco Commisso who will be to blame if Fiorentina suffer a rocky start to the season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Vincenzo Italiano has been appointed at the man who will guide Fiorentina through the chaos. Having previously taken Spezia into the Italian top-flight and kept them there, fans are happy with the decision. <br>
</p>
<p>
Italiano has promised to deliver an intense, aggressive, attacking style of football, despite the likelihood of them hovering around the bottom half of the table.<br>
</p>
<p>
All eyes will be on Hamed Traore for the coming season after the club secured his services from Empoli. Fiorentina have also added Matheus Henrique to their midfield - a signing which will excite the fans given he was a part of the Olympic gold medl winning Brazilian squad.<br>
</p>
<p>
Giacomo Raspadori may also be given the opportunity to secure a regular place in the starting XI as Francesco Caputo and Gregoire Defrel begin to slow down.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, Fiorentina have lost centre-back Marlon - who joined Shakhtar Donetsk on a permanent deal this summer - and will therefore need to maintain a defensive structure without him. <br>
</p>
<p>
Genoa came dangerously close to being relegated in the 2019-20 season and had hoped to prove themselves in the following campaign.<br>
</p>
<p>
Genoa managed 11 wins, 12 draws, and 16 defeats to finish the 2020-21 campaign in 11th place. It was loanee, Mattia Destro, who was the main reason Genoa stayed afloat last season - scoring 11 goals and registering an assist in 28 appearances.<br>
</p>
<p>
One of his most notable performances came against AC Milan, having grabbed a brace in their 2-2 draw.<br>
</p>
<p>
While Milan Badelj provided strength in midfield after joining on a free following his unsuccessful spell with Lazio.   <br>
</p>
<p>
The 32-year-old utilised a range of passes to give a side that previously struggled to play out the freedom to advance forwards. <br>
</p>
<p>
As a result, Davide Ballardini must get these men firing to be in with any hope of finishing higher up the table this season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Sinisa Mihajlovic replaced Filippo Inzaghi as Bologna coach in January 2019 and guided them out of the relegation zone to a 10th-place finish in his second spell at the Serie A club.<br>
</p>
<p>
He turned an otherwise lacklustre Bologna side into a dangerous attacking team that could push for a top half of the table finish on a good day. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, he did end the 2020-21 season with a seven-match winless streak - losing to the likes of Genoa.   <br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, Mihajlovic will look to utilise Musa Barrow, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Riccardo Orsolini in the 2021-22 season - focusing his tactics around their dynamism and pace.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Venezia have been promoted back to Serie A following a 19-year absence and a turbulent period in the club's history.<br>
</p>
<p>
The club secured their promotion to the top-flight following a 1-1 home draw in the second leg of their playoff final against Cittadella. The last gasp goal in the third minute of stoppage time triggered scenes of jubilation among the players and staff at the Pier Luigi Penzo Stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
Venezia's return to Serie A will mean a lot to the club after suffering three bankruptcies in 10 years and fighting their way out of the fourth tier in 2005, 2009 and 2015.<br>
</p>
<p>
Venezia are on a winning streak, having secured three promotions in six seasons. But, it is unlikely that the club will pull off a sensational top of the table finish this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Instead, they will focus on maintaining their place in the Italian top-flight after working so hard to get there.<br>
</p>
<p>
Udinese were another club that looked at changing their manager heading into the 2021-22 campaign. Luca Gotti's future at the club was up in the air after his contract expired in June. <br>
</p>
<p>
There were questions over whether he would be handed a contract extension after  an extremely disappointing campaign. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, negotiations with their other potential targets never materialised - forcing the club to stick with Gotti. <br>
</p>
<p>
As a result, Gotti - who spent most of his career as an assistant manager to Roberto Donadoni and Maurizio Sarri - will be under pressure to perform this season.     <br>
</p>
<p>
The Italian manager has a reputation for conservative, defensive football which may not sit well with the squad this season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Gotti has a strong attacking trio in Rodrigo De Paul, Kevin Lasagna and Stefano Okaka and must find a way to utilise their skill sets this season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Gotti will also be under more pressure this season, having lost Rodrigo De Paul to Atletico Madrid this summer. <br>
</p>
<p>
Given the challenge the Italian manager is set to face, it seems unlikely that they will match their previous thirteenth and fourteenth-place finishes this season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Instead, it is likely that they will sit further down the table, occupying 15th place.   <br>
</p>
<p>
Spezia Calcio have been hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons ahead of the 2021-2022 season. The Serie A side have been slapped with a two-year transfer ban by FIFA for illegally signing underage players from Nigeria.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Spezia were promoted to the top-flight last year for the first time ever and finished a creditable 15th but their bid to retain their new-found status has been made far harder by them being unable to register new signings. <br>
</p>
<p>
The two-year suspension is the longest transfer ban FIFA have ever handed out while the international governing body also fined Spezia 500,000 Swiss Francs (£393,000).  <br>
</p>
<p>
However, they have been able to sign new players this summer - with the ban due to kick in from January 2022 - but given the financial ramifications of the given fine, Spezia have done very little shopping.   <br>
</p>
<p>
Ivan Juric has left Hellas Verona in the hands of former Sassuolo coach Eusebio Di Francesco to join Torino for the 2021-2022 season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Juric was widely praised for winning the play-off with fifth-placed Hellas Verona in the second division before finishing ninth in the Serie A standings for the 2019-20 season.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Croatian boss managed to sustain his success with Verona in his third season in charge, before being pinched by Torino.<br>
</p>
<p>
He will now look to transfer such success into the team that finished the 2020-21 season in 17th place.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, in order to do so he must develop a well-rounded squad that does not rely on just Italy striker Andrea Belotti - who is out of contract next summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Leonardo Semplici will take charge of Cagliari heading into the 2021-22 season. The Italian football manager has a history of success and will look to maintain such a status by keeping the club afloat in Serie A. <br>
</p>
<p>
Semplici's winning streak started at SPAL in 2016 when he guided the club to back to back promotions from Serie C to Serie A in just two seasons. <br>
</p>
<p>
Semplici also won six of 15 matches when he first joined Cagliari in February - taking the club out of the relegation zone to finish the league in 14th place.<br>
</p>
<p>
Cagliari have also brought in several important places to strengthen their squad heading into the season. However, it seems unlikely that they will be able to avoid relegation this term.<br>
</p>
<p>
Empoli are another club that will head into the season with a new manager at the helm. Having lost Alessio Dionisi to Sassuolo they have drafted in Aurelio Andreazzoli to take charge of the club for a third time. <br>
</p>
<p>
The veteran manager has worked alongside some impressive names, including Luis Enrique and the legendary Zdenek Zeman.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, his track record in leading a top-flight side on his own is somewhat underwhelming. Andreazzoli took charge of Genoa in 2019 but lasted just nine games before being sacked. <br>
</p>
<p>
As a result, Andreazzoli will be looking to prove his worth with Empoli this season. However, it seems unlikely that he will be able to avoid the relegation zone with these underdogs.   <br>
</p>
<p>
Salernitana have an interesting history, having been in and out of bankruptcy. However, they hope to make the headlines for the right reasons this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
The current squad created history at the club after earning promotion into Serie A for the first time since 1999. They did so by beating Pescara 3-0 on the final day of the 2020-21 campaign.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, Fabrizio Castori's men will be looking to cement their place in the top-flight and avoid a repeat of history after the 1999 squad were immediately relegated back down.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, it seems unlikely that they will hold their own in the Italian top-flight this season given they are already running into issues. <br>
</p>
<p>
President Claudio Lotito must sell the club to allow Salernitana to compete in Serie A. As it stands, Lotito is also the chairman of Lazio - causing a conflict of interest. <br>
</p>

<h2>
Exiled midfielder Tanguy Ndombele 'tells Tottenham he IS open to leaving' before the end of the window... but Spurs face tricky task of finding a club to afford his £200,000 a week wages</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/16/46908505-0-image-a-60_1629473023816.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Tottenham midfielder Tanguy Ndombele could be on his way out of the club before the end of the transfer window after reportedly telling the north London side that he wants to leave.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 24-year-old has endured a tough time in north London since his club-record £55million move from Lyon in 2019. <br>
</p>
<p>
According to The Athletic, Ndombele has now taken matters into his own hands and has told the club he is 'open to leaving' but Spurs may struggle to find a buyer before the transfer window closes. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Frenchman didn't feature in any of Spurs' pre-season matches and despite being fit and available, he was left out of the squad against Manchester City last week.<br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking ahead of the game against his former club Wolves, Tottenham manager Nuno Espirito Santo said: 'He was not part of the squad in the Conference League because he was not part of the list.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I will be honest with you, Tanguy is not going to be involved on Sunday.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Ndombele's last appearance came towards the backend of last season when Spurs were defeated 2-1 at home by Aston Villa on May 19. <br>
</p>
<p>
He is the only fit senior player at the club to have not featured for Espirito Santo despite being there for the whole summer after missing out on France's Euro 2020 squad. <br>
</p>
<p>
Spurs opened their season last week with an impressive 1-0 over Manchester City at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
They travel to Wolves on Sunday and could be without talisman Harry Kane again as speculations over his future continue. <br>

<h2>
Manchester United 'suffer transfer blow as Leon Goretzka agrees to a new Bayern Munich long-term contract... with Joshua Kimmich also offered a deal to remain with the Bundesliga champions'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/17/46910811-0-image-a-11_1629475855127.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Manchester United may have been dealt a blow in their quest to buy a new central midfielder as Leon Goretzka is reportedly set to sign a new five-year deal with Bayern Munich.<br>
</p>
<p>
Paul Pogba's future at the club is still uncertain, with United prepared to make the Frenchman their best-paid player in an attempt to get him to snub Paris Saint-Germain by offering him an eye-watering £400,000-a-week deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Goretzka, Saul Niguez and French teenage sensation Eduardo Camavinga have all been touted as potential arrivals throughout the summer should Pogba leave for Mauricio Pochettino's men, but it now appears that the Bundesliga champions have tied down the German until 2026, with Joshua Kimmich possibly following suit, according to Munich-based reporter Florian Plettenberg.<br>
</p>
<p>
Plettenberg tweeted: 'News #Goretzka: Total agreement! He will sign a long-term contract in the next days. Probably until 2026 (like Kimmich). <br>
</p>
<p>
'Salary around €15million (£13m)/year. Important deal for both sides. Goretzka says yes as always reported.'  <br>
</p>
<p>
After Germany were dumped out of Euro 2020 in the round of 16 by England, Goretzka returned to Bayern duty under new boss Julian Nagelsmann, featuring in the first half of the 3-0 friendly defeat to Napoli on July 31.<br>
</p>
<p>
He then played the full 90 minutes in the Bundesliga opener against Borussia Monchengladbach which finished 1-1, before helping Nagelsmann to his first win in charge, a 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund to secure the German Super Cup on Tuesday. <br>
</p>
<p>
Saul, one of United's other targets, was singled out for praise by Red Devils legend Rio Ferdinand earlier this week.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ferdinand lauded the Spaniard on his FIVE Youtube channel, saying: 'I think if the right player becomes available for the right price, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will go and get him. <br>
</p>
<p>
'The problem is who is out there and who could be a good fit? Saul Niguez would be a perfect fit and he's asking price was £160m (€186m) a couple of years ago, now it's more like £40-50m (€47-58m).<br>
</p>
<p>
'In today's game that's a decent price for someone like him who has Champions League experience. I'm a big fan of his. If you can get him in this window, I think you do it.'<br>
</p>
<p>
After their 5-1 opening-game win over Leeds, Solskjaer's men take on Southampton on Saturday as they look to hang on to top spot in the embryonic Premier League table.<br>
</p>
<p>
£73m man Jadon Sancho is in contention to make his full debut after coming off the bench against Marcelo Bielsa's side, while Raphael Varane could make his first appearance for the club since joining from Real Madrid and Edinson Cavani may return after being handed an extended break by United to be with his family following the Copa America. <br>

Real Madrid hand Karim Benzema a one-year contract extension until 2023, keeping him at the Bernabeu until he's 35... with a staggering release clause worth €1BILLION!</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/16/46907981-0-image-a-29_1629472013147.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Real Madrid have handed serial top scorer Karim Benzema a new deal that will keep him at the club until 2023 – including a release clause worth €1 billion.<br>
</p>
<p>
The France forward's contract was due to expire next summer, and the La Liga giants have moved to ensure that they do lose their evergreen leading marksman.<br>
</p>
<p>
Deadly Benzema has top-scored for Madrid for the past three seasons and bagged a brace against Alaves on the opening day of the new campaign to prove his potency yet again.<br>
</p>
<p>
Club bosses were keen to ensure there was no repeat of club legend Sergio Ramos's departure when the captain's deal expired earlier this year.<br>
</p>
<p>
Negotiators have all but ruled out any prospect of the 33-year-old leaving the club before the deal expires by specifying that suitors will have to pay €1 billion to sign Benzema. <br>
</p>
<p>
Benzema joined Madrid from Lyon in 2009 and has gone on to notch 281 goals in 560 appearances, making him the club's fifth-top scorer of all time.<br>
</p>
<p>
The tireless 33-year-old talisman has won the Champions League four times and a hat-trick of Liga titles among a glittering haul since arriving at Los Blancos.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ten of his last 11 domestic campaigns have ended in double-figure goal tallies, hitting 23 last season to reach his highest total since 2016. <br>
</p>
<p>
Les Bleus boss Didier Deschamps restored Benzema to his squad for Euro 2020, and the 87-cap hotshot repaid him with four goals at the finals.<br>
</p>
<p>
Madrid are top of the early Liga table thanks to their emphatic 4-1 victory in their first game of the season.<br>

England women's side drop to EIGHTH in the FIFA World Rankings, their lowest for eight years - with new Lionesses boss Sarina Wiegman facing a tough rebuild after replacing Phil Neville as manager </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/16/46908497-0-image-a-47_1629472963918.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
England women's football team have sunk to eighth in the FIFA World Rankings, their lowest position in eight years, ahead of Sarina Wiegman's appointment as manager. <br>
</p>
<p>
The former Netherlands chief Wiegman, 51, will take over as boss in September, following the disappointing denouement of predecessor Phil Neville's tenure. <br>
</p>
<p>
Neville, struggling with what he admitted were 'unacceptable' performances, announced in April 2020 he would leave when his contract expired this summer, before resigning and leaving early to become Inter Miami manager in January.<br>
</p>
<p>
Norwegian Hege Riise took temporary charge, leading the side through three friendlies, winning the first 6-0 against Northern Ireland in February but losing 3-1 against France and 2-0 against Canada in April.<br>
</p>
<p>
New boss Wiegman, the No 1 target after beating the 141 other applicants, signed a four-year deal in August 2020 to take over from next month - allowing her to lead the Oranje at the Tokyo Olympics.<br>
</p>
<p>
She said in 2020: 'I am delighted and honoured to join England Women. England is the cradle of football and the major developments in women's football globally over recent years have been led by the FA. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I'm very much looking forward to contributing my experience and expertise to this ambitious team.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Although she has an impressive 73.7 per cent win ratio as Netherlands boss, winning the 2017 European Championship and reaching the final of the 2019 World Cup, Wiegman will have her work cut out for her. <br>
</p>
<p>
Whereas the Lionesses sat at second in the rankings three years ago, only behind the formidable United States, they have now dropped below Canada and are just one ahead of North Korea.<br>
</p>
<p>
Key midfielder Jill Scott is 34, captain Steph Houghton 33 and talismanic striker Ellen White 32, meaning the new manager will have to ease the transition to a new generation of players as well as implement a new style of play.<br>
</p>
<p>
Wiegman's first game in charge comes against North Macedonia in a World Cup qualifier at St Mary's on September 17, before an away match against Luxembourg four days later. <br>

<h2>
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reveals talks are ongoing between Manchester United and Paul Pogba over urgent new contract... while Red Devils boss confirms Jesse Lingard WILL have a role to play at Old Trafford this season</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/15/46905783-0-image-m-1_1629468893006.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says talks are continuing with Paul Pogba's camp to persuade the Frenchman to sign a new contract at Manchester United while he tries to keep the player happy on the pitch.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pogba has just over 10 months left on his £290,000-a-week deal before he can walk away from Old Trafford as a free agent for the second time.<br>
</p>
<p>
United are desperate for their record £89million signing to agree new terms, but so far Pogba and his agent Mino Raiola have shown little inclination to sign.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 28-year-old was outstanding in United's 5-1 opening-day win over Leeds last weekend, and Solskjaer is focussing on keeping Pogba happy on a day-to-day basis.<br>
</p>
<p>
Asked for an update on the player's situation, the United boss said: 'Well, that's negotiations with Paul's representatives and the club.<br>
</p>
<p>
'For me and Paul, we work together every day here and we keep on trying to improve, improve the team and to enjoy ourselves. When you win games, you enjoy yourselves more.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The Athletic reported this week that Pogba is set to receive an offer to become United's highest paid player on £400,000-a-week, surpassing David de Gea as the club's biggest earner. <br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer also indicated that Jesse Lingard is set to stay at Old Trafford this season despite spending the end of the last campaign out on loan at West Ham.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lingard is understood to be concerned about a lack of game time, but Solskjaer reassured the England international he has 'a big part to play'.<br>
</p>
<p>
He added: 'I think Jesse's first priority is to get into our team. I think whenever your employer is Man United, that's your first priority. It always is and we can have great moments together.<br>
</p>
<p>
'As a manager with players and a squad like I've got now, it's difficult to say they're not playing because, of course, I've got to leave players out never mind from the starting XI but from the squad.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But they all have to remember and know they're going to have to play a part if we're to be successful.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Jesse is back to his fitness. He's played really well in the behind-closed-doors game (against Burnley) on Tuesday and he's come back bubbly and in good shape. He's got a big part to play.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer confirmed that James Garner will go out on loan again, with Brandon Williams and Andreas Pereira set to make short-term moves to Norwich and Flamengo respectively.<br>
</p>
<p>
But Amad Diallo could remain part of the United squad after impressing since his return from the Tokyo Olympics where he represented Ivory Coast.<br>
</p>
<p>
'With Amad, I have to say he's done really well in training,' said Solskjar. 'He's come back a little bit later after the Olympics, he needed some time to get him back in and now he's looking really good.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I wouldn't be surprised if he stayed as well, but it has to be the right loan, right move, right club, right way of playing for any of our youngsters.'<br>

Liverpool's Brazilian star Fabinho is left devastated as his father passes away with midfielder's wife penning emotional tribute on social media for his 'smile and passion'</h2>

<p>
Liverpool star Fabinho has been left devastated after his father passed away, with his wife Rebeca Tavares sharing the news on social media.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Tavares took to social media on Friday morning to tell her 174,000 followers that Fabinho's father, Joao Roberto, had died.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tavares thanked God for having the privilege of knowing him and promised to take care of his son in a touching tribute.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Fabinho's wife shared an image of Fabinho's dad during a ceremony on Instagram. She wrote a caption that read: 'Father-in-law, you will always be remembered with that smile and passion for the things of the kingdom! <br>
</p>
<p>
'I thank God for the privilege of having known you. Your grandchildren will know the amazing grandfather they had. I love you father-in-law! Ah, I will take good care of your son #RIP'. <br>
</p>
<p>
She then confirmed the news on Twitter, by saying: 'For those who are asking on Instagram... Fabinho's father has passed. He will be missed.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp responded to the news saying: 'It's a private situation. Fab is here and doing what he's able to do. We all feel for him and with him. We try to give him all the love and all the warmth we have.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Supporters were quick to send their best wishes to the Liverpool star and his family following the announcement.<br>
</p>
<p>
One fan wrote: 'So sorry to hear this. He raised an incredible son so he must have been a wonderful human being. May he Rest In Peace.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Another added: 'Sorry to hear. R.I.P to Fabinho's father. Hope you and Fabinho are able to get through this tough time. We are all here for you guys YNWA.'  <br>
</p>
<p>
As a result of the news, the Brazilian midfielder will most likely miss this weekend's game against Burnley due to compassionate leave. <br>
</p>
<p>
Liverpool manager Klopp and goalkeeper Alisson Becker have also lost loved ones over the past 12 months.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Klopp's mother Elisabeth died on January 19 at the age of 81, while Alisson's father tragically drowned in a lake near his holiday home in southern Brazil in February.<br>
</p>
<p>
Klopp paid tribute to his mother telling fans, 'she meant everything to me' and described her as 'a real mum in the best sense of the word.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Alisson also paid tribute to his father after scoring a sensational injury-time winner for Liverpool against West Brom last season. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Brazil goalkeeper became the first Liverpool stopper to score in the club's history. In doing so, he secured a 2-1 win that put his team on course for Champions League qualification.<br>
</p>
<p>
Following the game Becker fought back tears as he said he hoped is dad was watching on before claiming the goal was for his 'family and for the boys'.<br>
</p>
<p>
At the time, Alisson said in his post match interview: 'I'm too emotional, with everything that's happened in my life recently with my family.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Football is my life, from since I remember with my father. I hope he was there watching and celebrating. That was for my family and for the boys.' <br>

Nuno Espirito Santo has NOT decided whether he will pick Harry Kane for Tottenham's trip to Wolves but insists the striker has 'trained good' despite pushing to join Manchester City</h2>

<p>
Nuno Espirito Santo says he will make a decision on Saturday as to whether Harry Kane is included in the squad for Sunday’s trip to Wolves.<br>
</p>
<p>
The England captain has not featured this season amid continuing speculation over his future and a move to Manchester City.<br>
</p>
<p>
Kane stayed behind to work on his fitness as Spurs were beaten 1-0 by Pacos de Ferreira in Portugal on Thursday night.<br>
</p>
<p>
And Nuno sounded positive when asked about the striker’s condition and availability on Friday.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘He trained today,’ said the Spurs boss. ‘He trained good. Tomorrow we will make a decision. It is a day-by-day situation.’<br>
</p>
<p>
But Nuno did confirm that club-record signing Tanguy Ndombele will not be at Molineux this weekend.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘I can be completely honest with you, Tanguy is not going to be involved in the squad on Sunday,’ he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ndombele - a £55million arrival from Lyon two years ago - has reportedly asked to leave the club this summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, centre-back Cameron Carter-Vickers looks set for a spell on the sidelines after twisting his ankle during the Europa Conference defeat by Pacos de Ferreira. Nuno said the injury ‘did not look good’.<br>

Christian Pulisic ruled OUT of Chelsea's London derby with Arsenal after Thomas Tuchel reveals American winger tested positive for Covid-19 despite having been fully vaccinated... as American takes to Instagram to assure fans he has no symptoms </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/14/46903515-0-image-a-38_1629465592673.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Thomas Tuchel has confirmed that Christian Pulisic will miss Chelsea's Premier League clash with Arsenal after testing positive for coronavirus.     <br>
</p>
<p>
The Blues midfielder tested positive on Wednesday morning, forcing him to forego the club's open training session which was played in front of fans at Stamford Bridge later that day. <br>
</p>
<p>
Pulisic has not trained with the first-team since his positive result and will isolate for a minimum of 10 days in line with UK Government guidelines - causing him to miss out on the London derby this weekend. <br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking ahead of the game on Sunday, Tuchel said: 'Christian (Pulisic) is unfortunately pretty easy to explain. <br>
</p>
<p>
'He had a positive test and needs to follow the protocols. He's not in training and not available for the game (against Arsenal).' <br>
</p>
<p>
Following the press conference, Pulisic released a statement on Instagram saying: 'Hi all, unfortunately I tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this week. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Thankfully I’m fully vaccinated and I have no symptoms so far. Can’t wait to get back in action! Thank you for your support.' <br>
</p>
<p>
The news comes as a blow to the Chelsea squad as Pulisic started for the Blues in their 3-0 win over Crystal Palace last Saturday. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, Tuchel has said that Romelu Lukaku is likely to make his second Chelsea debut after returning to the club this summer. <br>
</p>
<p>
When asked about the likelihood of Lukaku featuring for the Blues on Sunday, he said:' We have one more training session to go but the week was a heavy load. He was with the group with the late starters, so it was an overload week so far. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Today was low intensity and tomorrow we will have an important session before the match. We hope he will be on the pitch on Sunday and it looks likely.'<br>
</p>
<p>
He also explained how he hoped Lukaku would be the missing piece of the Chelsea jigsaw. He said: 'I believe everyone needs a role. <br>
</p>
<p>
'The guys who left us played an important role in the last campaign and it's not nice to let them go. But it sometimes important because everyone needs a role and a situation that needs fighting for.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Is Romelu the missing piece? We hope but at the same time we try to find solutions to any questions asked in games. <br>
</p>
<p>
'We want still have a strong squad and a squad that makes a team effort. Romelu is that kind of personality and profile that we were missing up front. From now, it's our job to push ourselves to the limit.'<br>

'We can't force anyone to do that': Ole Gunnar Solskjaer accepts it is up to his Manchester United players if they want to get double-vaccinated despite club encouraging them to do so amid a number of recent top-flight cases </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/14/46903449-0-image-m-24_1629465426405.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insists he cannot force his Manchester United players to get double-vaccinated quickly, but is encouraging his squad to do so. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Premier League is still feeling the effects of Covid even though England lifted most of its lockdown restrictions over the summer, with Arsenal having four players ruled out of first game last week while Chelsea's Christian Pulisic caught the virus this week. <br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer previously revealed that some United players are unsure about taking the vaccine and not all of his squad are double-jabbed even though the club want them to receive both doses. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ahead of United's match with Southampton on Sunday, Solskjaer told his pre-match press conference: 'They're not all double jabbed, no. I am, put it that way. I encourage the lads to take the vaccination but we can't force anyone to do that. <br>
</p>
<p>
'We're still wanting everyone to be double-jabbed and it's up to them, and it's still possible to take them.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The Red Devils suffered a coronavirus scare in pre-season as a friendly against Preston was cancelled due to an outbreak at the club which saw nine players test positive, but Solskjaer put that down to errors with the testing kit. <br>
</p>
<p>
One player who has struggled with the virus is United goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who has been feeling the effects of the disease for some time. <br>
</p>
<p>
Henderson first returned a positive test in July but only returned to training this month following his bout of Covid and despite feeling periods of tiredness recently, Solskjaer claims the man who finished last season as No 1 goalkeeper could return soon. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Norwegian added: 'The whole situation around Covid is still unknown and it’s new for everyone. That’s the scary bit. <br>
</p>
<p>
'You hear people, less fit people than footballers have it and no symptoms and footballers get prolonged side-effects and tiredness. It's a scary disease and virus so we need to be careful.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Dean was tired after training and we needed to check him. Now he feels much better and passed the tests and he’s training. <br>
</p>
<p>
'He’s building himself up again because he’s lost a few weeks. He's working hard on the grass. Not in full-team training yet but he won’t be long.' <br>
</p>
<p>
England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam reportedly urged all Premier League players last week to 'get vaccinated' as soon as possible after warning them that they 'can't outrun' the virus.<br>
</p>
<p>
A virtual meeting on August 2 was held by the Premier League with all 20 teams' captains in a bid to dispel any myths around the Covid jab and get vaccinated before the start of the new campaign.<br>
</p>
<p>
According to The Telegraph, Van-Tam and the Premier League medical officer Mark Gillett looked to reassure the players over the vaccine in the hope the information would reach their team-mates.<br>

Jurgen Klopp insists Liverpool are NOT out for revenge against 'ANNOYING' Burnley... after Sean Dyche's side ended the Reds' 68-game unbeaten run at Anfield in January </h2>
<p>
Jurgen Klopp claims Liverpool are not focusing on revenge against Burnley this weekend for beating them at Anfield last season, but has branded Sean Dyche's side as 'annoying'. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Reds lost to Burnley 1-0 at home in January which was their first Premier League home defeat for 68 matches, a run dating back to April 2017. Ashley Barnes netted a penalty seven minutes from time to earn Dyche's side a first win at Anfield since 1974.<br>
</p>
<p>
Klopp rowed with Dyche in the tunnel at half-time of the Anfield clash but was full of praise for the Clarets boss ahead of the next Premier League meeting on Merseyside this Saturday lunchtime. <br>
</p>
<p>
When asked if revenge against Burnley was on his mind, Klopp told his pre-match press conference: 'Not in the moment sitting here. I didn't even think about it. Now you told me, it's something. <br>
</p>
<p>
'It was a strange one but yes, we lost it. Burnley won it. That's how football is but it's nothing to do with the game now. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Sean is doing a brilliant job, he's set them up not only being annoying but it can be annoying as well. <br>
</p>
<p>
'(They are) good at set pieces and a clear way of playing - that's what we prepare for, not for any kind of revenge or whatever. We want to have a positive game and that only works when you play really good.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The Burnley defeat was the start of a terrible run of home defeats for Liverpool, who went on to lose their next five matches at Anfield, and only managed to score their first Premier League goal from open play in April.<br>
</p>
<p>
Klopp's side went ten matches unbeaten at the end of the season to scramble into a top-four spot but now the Reds have a full Anfield to support them on Saturday, but the German insisted he is not taking anything for granted this weekend. <br>
</p>
<p>
The German added: 'We will do everything as we have the first game in front of the home crowd for 520-something days I think and we want to enjoy it.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Football, it's only possible to be enjoyed when you play in a positive way and just go for it. <br>
</p>
<p>
'There are no guarantees out there, not at all, especially not against Burnley because they can make life really uncomfortable. Because they defend well, they have really good footballers in the team.'<br>

Steve Bruce reveals he is considering naming FOUR goalkeepers in Newcastle's 25-man Premier League squad this season due to injuries... meaning further summer signings are now unlikely</h2>

<p>
Newcastle are considering naming four goalkeepers in their 25-man Premier League squad - and Steve Bruce has warned that could affect transfer business.<br>
</p>
<p>
Number one stopper Martin Dubravka has suffered a setback following foot surgery and deputy Karl Darlow is still recovering from Covid-19.<br>
</p>
<p>
Freddie Woodman came in for his Premier League debut during last weekend’s 4-2 defeat by West Ham, with usual third-choice Mark Gillespie on the bench.<br>
</p>
<p>
And Bruce revealed: ‘We have a problem with the goalkeeping situation where we’re toying with the idea of naming four in the squad, which is unheard of.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘It’s a big concern - it’s not great when your two most experienced ones are struggling.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘We have to make that decision at the end of this month when we name our squad. It’s a difficult situation we find ourselves in, especially as the season has only been going a week.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘But we’ve had a setback with Dubravka, whose scar has got badly infected. That’s not looking very good. It will set him back a few weeks.<br>

<p>
‘And then Karl, who has been out of hospital a couple of weeks but is unfortunately nowhere near. He has still not overcome his Covid situation.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘He was in hospital for near enough a week. He was struck down and the severity of it is pretty evident when you saw him come out of hospital.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘So they are both a long way off.’<br>
</p>
<p>
Woodman was set for a loan move to Bournemouth but will now continue between the posts for Saturday’s trip to Aston Villa, for which Jonjo Shelvey will be missing with a calf problem.<br>
</p>
<p>
Should Woodman remain at the club then that could close the door on incomings, unless others were sold or loaned out. Sean Longstaff is in the last year of his contract and the club would want £10m were the likes of Everton to make a move.<br>
</p>
<p>
Bruce said: ‘If we had three goalkeepers then we’d have one space in the squad. If we name four then we have no space. So that does come into the reckoning.’<br>
</p>
<p>
The Magpies boss was given a budget of just £10m at the start of the summer but Mike Ashley was always going to make an exception for Joe Willock, the loanee who scored seven times last season and returned in a £25m deal from Arsenal last week.<br>
</p>
<p>
Bruce added: ‘I didn’t think we’d be able to buy Joe the way we did, we broke all the rules.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘So I will never say “never” (regarding more signings). If someone comes along who can help us then we will try to act. But we have a decently balanced squad.’<br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Bruce has revealed that many of his squad are refusing to get the Covid-19 vaccination.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘We have a lot of players who have not had the jab,’ he said. ‘That’s their prerogative.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘We had a Premier League meeting where half of it was about Covid and how important it is that people have the jab. A quarter of the people in hospital at the moment are under 30, simply because they’ve not had the jab.<br>
</p>
<p>
‘We’ve witnessed it with a few of our players who were really sick. I would advise you get the jab.’<br>

<p>
The summer transfer window is alive and kicking as clubs throughout Europe look to cement their squads ahead of next season.<br>
</p>
<p>
The future of England captain Harry Kane is set to be major talking point throughout the window, though the Tottenham forward has now returned to the club. <br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the bombshell that Lionel Messi has left Barcelona for PSG will certainly have a drastic impact on the transfer market. <br>
</p>
<p>
It's the Manchester clubs who have made the biggest splash so far, with United signing Jadon Sancho for £73m and City's £100m acquisition of Jack Grealish shattering the British transfer record.    <br>

Don't worry about a thing! Ajax unveil stunning Bob Marley-inspired 'Three Little Birds' third kit with Dutch giants to wear kit dedicated to reggae icon in European matches</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/08/46895431-0-image-a-4_1629446154150.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
As the domestic campaigns across Europe begin, clubs are still unveiling their new kits for the season. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ajax and Adidas, in collaboration with Bob Marleys's family, have unveiled the club's new 2021-22 third kit, paying tribute to the iconic Reggae artist. <br>
</p>
<p>
The kit is a tribute to the Dutch club's fans and their love for Marley's song - 'Three Little Birds'.<br>
</p>
<p>
The black kit also includes red, yellow and green details and at the back of it, under the collar, three birds are sat on on Amsterdam's Andreas crosses - referring to the song. <br>
</p>
<p>
Ajax's association with the song began in 2008 during a friendly against Cardiff City, in the Welsh capital. <br>
</p>
<p>
The fans were asked to remain in the stadium after the game and 'Three little birds' was blasted out. It quickly became a fans' favourite song to the point that it's now played during every home game.<br>
</p>
<p>
Fans took it to Twitter to express their opinions on the new kit - and it wasn't just Ajax supporters who were delighted with it.  <br>
</p>
<p>
'This kit is FIRE!!!!! yooo I will buy this!!!', said a Chelsea fan.  <br>
</p>
<p>
'Ajax always nails it when it comes to their kits', an Arsenal fan tweeted.  <br>
</p>
<p>
An Ajax fan added, 'These are nice third shirts'. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Dutch side will wear the kit alongside their home one during their Champions League games this season. <br>

<h2>
Jamie Carragher says Manchester City 'got their priorities wrong' by signing £100m Jack Grealish when Harry Kane 'should have already been paraded in a shirt'... and should eye Kylian Mbappe as 'Plan B' if Tottenham now won't sell</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/10/46898327-0-image-a-7_1629452770023.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Manchester City should have concentrated on capturing Harry Kane for Tottenham's £150 million asking price ahead of the signing of Jack Grealish, Premier League legend Jamie Carragher has warned.<br>
</p>
<p>
The reigning champions spent £100 million to sign playmaker Jack Grealish earlier this month, matching the amount they offered Spurs for Kane in June.<br>
</p>
<p>
With the England captain under contract until 2024, Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is thought to be holding out for the full fee for his wantaway talisman – and Carragher believes Kane should be as frustrated by City's tactics as he is with his club.<br>
</p>
<p>
Carragher has called City's approach to snaring Kane 'bizarre' and claimed that the 28-year-old should be asking why club owner Sheikh Mansour has not matched his market value. <br>
</p>
<p>
Writing in the Telegraph, Carragher said: 'As the supposed number one summer target, he should already have been paraded in his City shirt.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It is difficult to understand how City imagined this would play out any differently than it has over the past two months.<br>
</p>
<p>
'From the moment it became clear Kane would push for a transfer, and City were preparing their move, everyone in football foresaw the current state of affairs. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Anything less than £150 million for the England captain is going to be met with an instant rebuke.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The arrival of Grealish from Aston Villa has supplemented a City midfield already blessed with the likes of Phil Foden and Kevin De Bruyne, Carragher says. <br>
</p>
<p>
'City obviously had the funds to buy Kane for £150 million at the start of the summer but decided to match the £100 million clause for Jack Grealish. At the moment, it looks like they got their priorities wrong.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Grealish is a fine player. He will do well at City. I understand why he wanted to move. What I cannot get my head around is why City did not attend to their more pressing needs first. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Signing Grealish will not be the difference between City defending their title or finally winning the Champions League this season.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Signing Kane, or a world-class striker capable of scoring between 20 or 30 goals this season, might be.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Carragher now feels that it is make-or-break time for City to add a cutting edge to their intricate play, suggesting PSG prodigy Kylian Mbappe, whose contract expires next year, as another worthy transfer target.<br>
</p>
<p>
'That was clear in last weekend's defeat to Spurs,' he said. 'Despite that, the Premier League champions pushed ahead with the Grealish deal while waiting for events to materialise on Kane's future.<br>
</p>
<p>
'That will backfire if they do not act in the next fortnight, to either secure Kane or a worthy alternative.<br>
</p>
<p>
'City must have considered a Plan B in the event of Spurs refusing to sell Kane. There would be more value in trying to sign Kylian Mbappe for in excess of £100 million a year before his contract expires at PSG, for example.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Carragher blames 'antipathy' between City boss Pep Guardiola and agent Mino Raiola for their failure to pursue Borussia Dortmund wonderkid Erling Haaland with conviction.<br>
</p>
<p>
He said: 'It is inconceivable City will not add at least one new striker to their squad.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It will not be a good look, nor a reflection of good planning, to see the best team in the world, with the best coach in the world, with a seemingly unlimited budget, scrambling around hunting for a striker in the final two weeks of the transfer window.'<br>

Ronald Koeman takes swipe at Barcelona starlet Ilaix Moriba amid bitter contract stand-off as 'disappointed' boss says 'money CANNOT be the most important thing for an 18-year-old'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/12/46899907-0-image-a-2_1629457346803.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman has taken a swipe at 18-year-old midfielder Ilaix Moriba amid a contract stand-off and said 'money cannot be the most important thing for an 18-year-old'.    <br>
</p>
<p>
Moriba has a year remaining on his current contract and it has been widely reported that he has rejected the offer of a new one due to the eye-watering £343million release clause that Barcelona wanted to insert into the contract. <br>
</p>
<p>
Koeman has however hit back at the teenager, claiming that money should not be the most important factor for him. <br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking ahead of their match against Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, Koeman said: 'My advice is that money cannot be the most important thing for an 18-year-old. <br>
</p>
<p>
'It's about playing games. But the player and his camp think differently. I am disappointed.'<br>
</p>
<p>
In what was perceived as a power play by the club, Moriba was left out of the squad for Barcelona's friendly against UE Olot earlier this month.  <br>
</p>
<p>
President Joan Laporta revealed that Moriba would not be extending but claimed the club has other plans in place. <br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking earlier this month, he said: 'We hope that we don't get a repeat of the Ilaix case, he is a player with one year left on his contract and he doesn't want to renew.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's a situation that we won't accept and we have to act and send out a message.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He is a great player but if he doesn't want to renew there are other solutions.'<br>
</p>
<p>
The youngster came through the famous La Masia academy and impressed Koeman with his ability. <br>
</p>
<p>
He made 14 La Liga appearances last season and scored his first league goal in a 2-0 win against Osasuna in March. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Catalonian club opened their season with a 4-2 win over Real Sociedad at the Nou Camp last week.  <br>

Kylian Mbappe 'leads a list of Man United targets next summer including Erling Haaland and Harry Kane - if he doesn't join Man City' as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer plots a move for a 'big-name forward' </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/12/46900759-0-image-a-34_1629459440196.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland and Harry Kane are on a heavyweight list of Manchester United targets as the club bids to make a huge signing next summer, according to reports.<br>
</p>
<p>
France hitman Mbappe is thought to be Real Madrid's number one priority in a move that could be sealed before the end of the transfer window on September 1, but United are keeping a 'watching brief' on the World Cup winner's situation, ESPN says.<br>
</p>
<p>
United are keenly aware of Madrid's prolonged interest in Mbappe, the report claims, with bosses said to be ready to meet the 22-year-old's hefty wage expectations in the event of him becoming available without a transfer fee in 2022.<br>
</p>
<p>
Mbappe is believed to be ready to choose Spain over the Premier League and complete a long-rumoured switch to the LaLiga giants by the start of next season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Madrid freed up more funds for his signing by completing the sale of defender Raphael Varane to United in a £42 million deal last week. <br>
</p>
<p>
Premier League contenders United have also reportedly put Borussia Dortmund prodigy Haaland and a sensational bid for Harry Kane on their list of options.<br>
</p>
<p>
Tottenham talisman Kane is embroiled in a stand-off between Spurs and long-term suitors Manchester City, whose summer bid for the England captain was £50 million short of the £150 million asking price.<br>
</p>
<p>
United could capitalise if their arch-rivals failure to capture the 28-year-old this season, viewing him as an updgrade on Edinson Cavani ahead of the Uruguay forward's anticipated departure at the end of the campaign.<br>
</p>
<p>
Haaland looks set to stay at Dortmund this season despite his agent, Mino Raiola, holding talks with Real Madrid and Barcelona in Spain in April.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea have also shown interest in meeting the £150 million price tag for the Norway and Bundesliga phenomenon.<br>
</p>
<p>
Haaland scored in both halves as Dortmund won 5-2 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in their opening game of the German top-flight season on Saturday.<br>

<h2>
Afghanistan's US-based women's football captain calls on FIFA to step in to 'save my team-mates', who are in hiding with the Taliban knowing their home addresses, and fear they will be killed for 'using football to give women a new voice'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/10/46897983-0-image-a-1_1629451983532.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
The captain of the Afghanistan women's team has called on FIFA to help 'save' her team-mates from the Taliban after the country fell to the Islamist group.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The future of Afghan women remains uncertain after the Taliban took control of capital city Kabul earlier this week, with women's rights severely suppressed when the group last ruled the country between 1996 and 2001. <br>
</p>
<p>
Previously, Afghan women were not allowed to work, study, or be treated by male doctors unless accompanied by a male chaperone. Individuals who violated the sexist laws were imprisoned, publicly flogged, and even executed.<br>
</p>
<p>
And with the lives of many of her football team-mates under threat, national team captain Shabnam Mobarez, 25, who is currently residing in the United States, has asked the world football governing body to intervene in the situation in her home country. <br>
</p>
<p>
Recalling a conversation with one of her peers on Twitter, Mobarez posted her interpretation of the conversation, which started with her saying: '“are you okay?”<br>
</p>
<p>
'My teammate in Afghanistan: “No I am not - I know they will come for me soon, can you help me?”<br>
</p>
<p>
'@FIFAcom how should I answer the question? We must act to save my teammates. They are my sisters?'<br>
</p>
<p>
Under Taliban rule starting in 1996, girls were banned from attending school, while women could only appear in public wearing full body coverings and accompanied by male escorts.<br>
</p>
<p>
Women who did not faithfully observe the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islamic law were publicly flogged or executed. The international community eventually worked to open schools for girls and allowed women to return to work following the Taliban's ousting from power in 2001 after US intervention. <br>
</p>
<p>
This allowed the Afghanistan national women's team to be formed in 2007, with the squad playing their first ever competitive match three years later and the country picked up its first win against Qatar in 2012.<br>
</p>
<p>
Upon the Taliban taking over the country this week, former national team captain Khalida Popal urged all the women's players to delete their social media accounts and even burn their kits to protect their identities and their lives. <br>
</p>
<p>
Mobarez, meanwhile, revealed that football was used as a way to give women power in Afghanistan, but now she feels helpless in trying to reassure her team-mates that everything will be alright.<br>
</p>
<p>
Speaking of her team-mates, she told Tribuna Expresso this week: 'They fought to empower women in Afghanistan, we tried to use football as a tool to give women a new voice and make them fight for their rights, but now it seems that football is something that can endanger them, and potentially kill them, which is heartbreaking. <br>
</p>
<p>
'I talk to them regularly on WhatsApp and do my best not to let them down. When I was captain of the national team, I used to tell the players that everything was going to be fine, that we were going to overcome everything together. <br>
</p>
<p>
'Now, when I talk to them, they cry on the phone and fear for their lives. I can't tell them it's going to be okay, because I'm not sure what's going to happen tomorrow, or a week from now.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Mobarez also revealed that the Afghan Football Federation has given up on the team, hence why she is appealing to FIFA for help. <br>
</p>
<p>
'They are hidden in the home of family or friends, without revealing their identity. Even the Afghan Football Federation members and staff simply disappeared, they were supposed to protect them and there is no one there.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It looks like the people who had the money left and now we have all these helpless women left to fend for themselves.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I would love to be able to help them more, but the situation is so tense that, right now, if they leave the house, they will be killed. <br>
</p>
<p>
'For now, the best thing to do is wait for the situation to calm down. There is a chance that the Taliban will knock on their door and tomorrow they will no longer be with us.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, male Afghan national youth team footballer Zaki Anwari, 19, died when he became trapped in the landing gear of a US evacuation flight in a desperate attempt to flee the Taliban.<br>
</p>
<p>
The promising teenage player rushed to the airport hours after Kabul fell to the Taliban, joining thousands of others in pouring onto the runway and then chasing after the USAF jet despite warning shots ringing out. <br>
</p>
<p>
Mr Anwari's death was confirmed by the General Directorate of Physical Education & Sports of Afghanistan, Arian News reported on Thursday. <br>
</p>
<p>
The United States Air Force later said that the pilots decided to go ahead with takeoff because the jet 'was surrounded' and there was a 'rapidly deteriorating security situation around the aircraft.' <br>
</p>
<p>
The beloved teen had attended the prestigious French-speaking Esteqlal High School, in Kabul, and had been called up to the national youth team as a 16-year-old. His 'unspeakable loss' was mourned by his friends and peers on social media on Thursday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Afghanistan's assistant manager Ali Askar Lali said: 'May his soul rest in peace and his memory be remembered.' <br>
</p>
<p>
 Britain has promised to evacuate some 7,000 UK citizens and Afghan staff from the country, in addition to 5,000 refugees, but armed forces minister James Heappey has said that 'that sad truth is, we don't have it in our gift to stay there until absolutely everyone is out'. <br>
</p>
<p>
Britain evacuated 2,163 people from Kabul between Sunday night and Friday morning, and is aiming to take out another 1,000 per day as long as flights can keep operating.<br>
</p>
<p>
In total, the UK has now taken some 3,800 people out of Afghanistan in recent weeks, including more than 600 UK citizens and thousands of Afghans covered by the resettlement scheme.<br>
</p>
<p>
To keep its most-modest promises, the UK must evacuate some 3,200 people - but up to 8,200 if the prime minister's pledge to take refugees is to be met.<br>

<p>
Kai Havertz will wear a pair of personally-designed, limited edition boots against Arsenal and auction them off as part of his campaign to raise funds to help those affected by the fatal floods in western Germany.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea's Champions League final hero has family who still live in the North Rhine-Westphalia district and spent time as he grew up in some of the areas that were worst hit by last month's floods which were caused by torrential rain.<br>
</p>
<p>
At least 58 people died and almost 4000 flood victims lost their homes and were forced to move into emergency accommodation.<br>
</p>
<p>
Havertz has sent a number of gifts to his homeland to support help those in need, including €200,000 in cash.<br>
</p>
<p>
And he hopes to generate further money to support Red Cross Germany from the Nike boots he has designed himself in the colours of the North Rhine –Westphalia flag, green white and red. Ninety-nine other pairs will be sold to raise money for charity.<br>
</p>
<p>
Attacking midfielder Havertz's shirt from Sunday's clash will also be up for grabs with the auction running from Sunday August 22 to Friday August 27 via Charity Stars while donations can be made on the Red Cross's donation page.<br>
</p>
<p>
Havertz said: 'I'm in a hugely privileged situation and I hope by starting this campaign supporting the Red Cross Germany I can inspire others to give what they can to help.<br>
</p>
<p>
'My limited edition boots are a sign of solidarity with those suffering, to show that I stand with my community and I am thinking of them.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I was so shocked when I first saw the images, it's difficult to comprehend what the people must be going through right now, but I knew I had to do something.<br>
</p>
<p>
'By donating money, we can help Red Cross Germany with their relief and assistance efforts on the ground to make sure it gets to people that need it most.<br>

Cambridge United hand fan a 10-game ban for attending TWO away games this season during the isolation period after testing positive for Covid</h2>

<p>
Cambridge United have banned a fan who breached Covid regulations for their  games against Accrington Stanley and Plymouth Argyle earlier this month. <br>
</p>
<p>
The supporter in question had previously tested positive for coronavirus and was required to self-isolate for 10 full days. However, he attended the Cambridge United fixtures before his isolation period was up. <br>
</p>
<p>
As a result of his actions, he fan has been banned from attending Cambridge United's next 10 home and away matches. <br>
</p>
<p>
The individual who broke the Covid rules earlier this month is said to be a vulnerable person who has been diagnosed with autism.  <br>
</p>
<p>
The supporter reportedly tested negative on the night of the Plymouth Argyle game, but those who were sat in the same stand as the individual for both fixtures have been made aware of the issue. <br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail understands that the police have not been involved in the process and that the matter has been dealt with internally at the club.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Cambridge United released a statement on their website following the decision to ban the individual, saying that they will judge each Covid breach on a case-by-case basis. <br>
</p>
<p>
The club also reaffirmed their commitment to providing a safe environment for their supporters and reminded fans of their responsibility to 'protect themselves and others whilst the threat of Covid-19 continues to exist.'    <br>

Arsenal hit the century! Gunners' spending passes £100m as they confirm £30m Martin Odegaard returns from Real Madrid and takes No 8 shirt - but he CAN'T face Chelsea on Sunday</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/09/46894473-0-image-a-11_1629449416666.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Arsenal have confirmed the £30million signing of Martin Odegaard from Real Madrid after the Norwegian spent the second half of last season on loan at the Emirates Stadium.<br>
</p>
<p>
Manager Mikel Arteta has been determined to bring in a playmaker and talks over signing Odegaard, 22, on a permanent basis have been ongoing throughout the summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
He impressed in his 20 appearances for the Gunners from late January onwards, scoring twice and setting up two further goals. He has been handed the No 8 shirt at The Emirates. <br>
</p>
<p>
Odegaard was absent from Real Madrid's training session on Wednesday while the finer points of the deal were thrashed out and now Arsenal have confirmed the signing.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Norway international of 30 appearances has not completed his move on time make his debut in the London derby against Chelsea on Sunday, however.<br>
</p>
<p>
Instead, his second Gunners bow could come in the Carabao Cup against West Brom on Wednesday August 25.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Odegaard's signing is Arsenal's fourth of the summer following defender Ben White, left-back Nuno Tavares from Benfica and midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga from Anderlecht.<br>
</p>
<p>
It takes their spending to £102m as the Gunners aim to improve on last season's eighth place finish in the Premier League, which saw them miss out on European football for the first time in 25 years.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ben White (Brighton, £50m)<br>
</p>
<p>
Martin Odegaard (Real Madrid, £30m)<br>
</p>
<p>
Albert Sambi Lokonga (Anderlecht, £15.75m)<br>
</p>
<p>
Nuno Tavares (Benfica, £7.2m)<br>
</p>
<p>
The current campaign started in disappointing fashion with a 2-0 defeat at newly-promoted Brentford last Friday but Odegaard will hope to inspire an upturn in their fortunes.<br>
</p>
<p>
It ends Arsenal's interest in Leicester City's James Maddison though the Foxes' asking price of £60m was proving prohibitive.<br>
</p>
<p>
They do, however remain linked to Lyon's Houssem Aouar with the French club open to a sale to ease financial pressures.<br>
</p>
<p>
Odegaard burst onto the scene in Norway back in April 2014, when aged just 15 years and 118 days he played for Stromgodset against Aalesunds. He was the youngest footballer ever to play in the Norwegian Tippeligaen.<br>
</p>
<p>
By January 2015, Odegaard was on his way to Real Madrid in a deal worth 4 million euros, potentially rising to 8.5m euros depending on certain conditions.<br>

<p>
Odegaard made his debut for the Real first team in May 2015, replacing Cristiano Ronaldo in a 7-3 win over Getafe to become the club's youngest-ever debutant at 16 years and 157 days.<br>
</p>
<p>
However, he was never afforded many first-team opportunities and played just 11 times for Real amidst four different loan spells.<br>
</p>
<p>
Odegaard was sent out to Dutch club Heerenveen for two seasons, then Vitesse Arnhem, Real Sociedad and finally Arsenal.<br>
</p>
<p>
The highlight of his loan last season was scoring in a 2-1 win over Tottenham in the north London derby in March. He also netted against Olympiacos in the UEFA Europa League.  <br>
</p>
<p>
His first senior international appearance came in August 2014 against the United Arab Emirates at the age of just 15 years and 253 days.<br>
</p>
<p>
In March of this year, Odegaard was appointed Norway captain by new manager Stale Solbakken.<br>
</p>
<p>
Still only 22, he has amassed 235 career appearances at club level, scoring 34 goals.<br>

<h2>
James Rodriguez admits he cares so little about Everton that he 'doesn't even know' who they play next... and £220,000-per-week superstar says 'anything could happen' as he looks to quit after Carlo Ancelotti left </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/11/46898845-0-image-a-2_1629454491130.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
James Rodriguez has shockingly revealed that he 'doesn't even know' who Everton are playing this weekend, as the Colombian's future remains unclear. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 30-year-old was unable to feature in Everton's opening-day win over Southampton, being one of five players who had to isolate due to coronavirus issues.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Everton play Leeds at Elland Road on Saturday afternoon but Rodriguez, whose future remains unclear having been told he can leave this summer, revealed on his Twitch stream that he won't be in action once more - while stating he wasn't actually sure who their opponents were. <br>
</p>
<p>
*Odds as per Betfair<br>
</p>
<p>
Rodriguez still hasn't played in front of the Everton faithful since making his stunning £20million switch from Real Madrid last summer, though revealing he will return to the Toffees' Finch Farm training base next week.  <br>
</p>
<p>
'I will start training on Monday, I think', Rodriguez explained on his stream.<br>
</p>
<p>
'On the weekend I will not play, I don't even know who Everton is playing, can you please tell me?'<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think it is away because the past was here at home,' he said shortly after, 'Ah, against Leeds they play, away from home, against (Marcelo) Bielsa, a difficult game, let's see what happens, hopefully they win.'  <br>
</p>
<p>
The midfielder's position at the club has been particularly precarious since Carlo Ancelotti left for Real Madrid, with former Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez coming to Goodison Park as his replacement. <br>
</p>
<p>
Everton have spent just £1.7m this summer, signing Asmir Begovic, Andros Townsend and Demarai Gray, with Benitez admitting that they must sell before buying due to Financial Fair Play rules. <br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail revealed back in June that Rodriguez was being offered to clubs around Europe, with Porto expressing an interest for the midfielder, who earns around £220,000 per week. <br>
</p>
<p>
With less than two weeks remaining before transfer deadline day on August 31, Rodriguez says anything could happen. <br>
</p>
<p>
He added: 'I have faith that this season will be good for me, big things are coming for me.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Between now and August 30, anything can happen, I don't know where I'll play, I'll be where things go well.'<br>
</p>
<p>
When asked about Rodriguez during his pre-match press conference on Friday, Rafa Benitez said: 'Until August 31, he is part of my plans.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Rodriguez's comments come after he admitted he just wants to play where he's wanted in a previous stream.  <br>
</p>
<p>
'I don't know what's going to happen,' he told the fans. 'I don't know – I don't know where I'm going to play.<br>
</p>
<p>
'You know that in football and in life you don't know anything, but all I know is that I've been training hard, preparing well, training for myself and that's it.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It's complicated. [I will play] wherever I'm wanted. Someone has to be at a place they're wanted.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Rodriguez made a promising start to life with Everton, fishing his debut season with six goals and nine assists in 26 appearances. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, many of the fans have been left furious by Rodriguez's apparent lack of interest. <br>
</p>
<p>
Reacting to Rodriguez's latest comments, one fan wrote on Twitter: 'I don’t care who you are, if you don’t want to be at my club I don’t want you there. Get rid and make space for someone who can be arsed.' <br>
</p>
<p>
Another wrote: 'Funny how James Rodriguez attitude seems to of changed towards the club now he’s got a manager that isn’t prepared to let him jet off all over the place whenever he sees fit. If he put as much energy into his football as he does on cod he’d be flying.'<br>
</p>
<p>
One angry fan added: 'Remember when some supporters were up in arms about how we couldn't possible get rid of James because of great he is and how he wants to stay with Everton? The guy sits at home all day playing COD on Twitch and doesn't even know who we play this weekend.'<br>

<h2>
Real Madrid want 'Kylian Mbappe or nobody' as they make him their sole target before his deal ends in 2022... with Erling Haaland an option if PSG striker sees out his contract</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/10/46897637-0-image-a-16_1629450611560.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Real Madrid are determined to snap up PSG prodigy Kylian Mbappe before the transfer window closes and have dropped their interest in other top strikers to focus on signing him, according to reports.<br>
</p>
<p>
France hotshot Mbappe is out of contract in 2022 and has repeatedly been linked with a move to the Bernabeu, where bosses are now said to be aiming all of their efforts on capturing the World Cup winner before his deal ends.<br>
</p>
<p>
PSG manager Mauricio Pochettino and sporting director Leonardo have both claimed that Mbappe is staying at the Parc des Princes, although the 22-year-old shows no signs of signing a new contract that would secure his long-term future with the Ligue 1 giants.<br>
</p>
<p>
That has kept the door ajar for Madrid to pounce, with Los Blancos boss Carlo Ancelotti turning down opportunities to sign Lyon playmaker Houssem Aouar and Monaco midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni in order to concentrate on his primary transfer target, according to Marca.<br>
</p>
<p>
Madrid are in a position to test PSG's resolve by bidding for Mbappe with some of the £250 million they are thought to have raised through sales including the departures of Martin Odegaard to Arsenal and Raphael Varane to Manchester United. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Spanish outlet says that Borussia Dortmund phenomenon Erling Haaland could be an option for Madrid if Mbappe stays at PSG, having already held talks with the club through his agent, Mino Raiola, in April. <br>
</p>
<p>
The end of the transfer window on September 1 gives Madrid under two weeks to complete their business, with the club reportedly adopting an attitude of 'Mbappe or nobody'.<br>
</p>
<p>
Ancelotti is said to have no interest in Bayern Munich goal machine Robert Lewandowski, who is widely reported to be seeking a new challenge away from the Bundesliga champions.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Madrid manager also took the unusual step of personally dismissing a move for Juventus talisman Cristiano Ronaldo this week, taking to Twitter to insist he has 'never considered' trying to return the Portugal captain to the club where he spent nine hugely successful years.  <br>
</p>
<p>
Discussing Mbappe ahead of PSG's trip to Brest on Friday night, Pochettino said:  'I see that he is motivated, working hard to making this a great season.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He is our player and I don't see him not being here this season. He has a year left on his contract, even if he doesn't renew it, and he has demonstrated to me that he is happy with us here.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He is calm and the club knows what they're going to do. We know he is our player and that he is preparing for our match.' <br>
</p>
<p>
'As long as the transfer market is open, there will be many rumours circulating.' <br>

<h2>
Mikel Arteta left stunned by Premier League allowing Arsenal's opening game to go ahead after four players tested positive in a Covid outbreak... but he admits some of his stars are NOT vaccinated - and there's no set number of cases to cancel a match </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/08/46894299-0-image-a-1_1629444011459.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Mikel Arteta says he was 'surprised' that Arsenal's game with Brentford was not called off due to a Covid-19 outbreak in the Gunners' squad.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arteta's side were without captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette for the opening night of the Premier League after the attacking pair both tested positive for the virus.<br>
</p>
<p>
Willian and back-up goalkeeper Alex Runarsson also returned positive tests. Arsenal were subsquently beaten 2-0 by Thomas Frank's newly promoted side but Arteta admitted he had been expecting the game to be postponed before kick-off.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Yes, I was surprised but the regulators decided the best thing to do was to play the game,' Arteta said at his press conference ahead of Sunday's clash with Chelsea.<br>
</p>
<p>
There is no set threshold or number of Covid positives required in order for a Premier League game to be called off.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal confirmed to Sportsmail that they had not made a request for the match to be postponed. <br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday that the game was just hours away from being called off after the entire travelling Arsenal party were forced to take emergency Covid tests on the day of the game.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail understands that staff were asked to take additional tests on Saturday, a scheduled day off.<br>
</p>
<p>
Captain Aubameyang, whose wife Alysha posted pictures on social media of a family birthday party just days before the striker’s positive test, has now recorded a negative result and will be assessed ahead of Sunday’s home game against Chelsea.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lacazette and Runarsson are still recovering and won’t be available for the visit of the European champions but Willian is being assessed ahead of the clash against his former club.<br>
</p>
<p>
Premier League clubs are testing twice a week but there was enough concern over Arsenal’s visit to newly promoted Brentford that Gunners players, the coaching team and other associated staff were told to take tests on the day of the game.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arteta confirmed most of his squad have received at least one Covid vaccine and said the club are trying to encourage all of the players to get fully vaccinated, but admitted not all have taken up the option.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Most of them are double vaccinated. Others have had one vaccine. We are trying to encourage them to get vaccinated, but it's a personal matter. <br>
</p>
<p>
'At the end it's a personal decision. It's not about protecting ourselves, it's about protecting the people around us as well.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail revealed last month that Premier League clubs were imposing 'emergency measures' ahead of the new season after a spate of Covid cases following the summer break.<br>
</p>
<p>
Clubs were advised by the Premier League to impose stricter Covid guidelines, with the rules similar to to the restrictions that accompanied Project Restart when football returned during the first Covid lockdown in the summer of 2020.<br>
</p>
<p>
Restrictions required medical staff to be equipped in full PPE when in contact with playing staff, with a 15-minute time limit on treatment also being reinstated.<br>
</p>
<p>
The measures also included social distancing and masks in indoor areas and masks are required at training grounds. Inspectors will also make routine visits to clubs to ensure guidelines are being adhered to.<br>
</p>
<p>
There is some feeling from Premier League clubs that the 'emergency measures' could be in place until October.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal were one of the clubs hardest hit by Covid cases during pre-season and they were forced to cancel their tour to of the United States.<br>

Steven Gerrard urges Rangers players to 'wake up' after narrow victory over Alashkert in Europa League play-off following stuttering start to the season</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/09/46896765-0-image-a-97_1629448597320.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Steven Gerrard told his Rangers players to wake up following the 1-0 Europa League play-off win over Alashkert at Ibrox.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Scottish side, knocked out of the Champions League last week by Malmo, struggled in the first half then suffered a blow in the 43rd minute when midfielder John Lundstram was sent off by referee Anastasios Sidiropoulos for picking up a second yellow card.<br>
</p>
<p>
Alfredo Morelos' strike in the 67th minute restored confidence ahead of the second leg in Armenia but boss Gerrard was far from happy.<br>
</p>
<p>
He said: 'I've got confidence and belief we can get going and restart and show we can get back to the form we need - but we need to wake up now.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We're in competitions and we're at a club where you can't afford to be where we are right now.<br>
</p>
<p>
'We need to find our level and we need to wake up right now.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The players listened to what I had to say at half time and we got a reaction and we went on to win the game.<br>
</p>
<p>
'But we should have made this game so much more comfortable than we have.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I am not here to talk about individuals, I am here to talk about the group.<br>
</p>
<p>
'The first-half performance was nowhere where I needed it or wanted it to be.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I had to be really honest in the dressing room and we got the reaction from the players but if we had got the right performance over the 90 minutes I would be sitting here in a much better position.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Tonight wasn't really about tactics or blocks, the players know all the information and solutions, it was way beyond tactics in the first half.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Before you worry about tactics, you have to show fight, heart, desire, you have to be committed, you have to run through walls, you have to show these fans here that you are prepared to be all in, before you talk about tactics.'<br>

Inter Miami are 'confident of beating Newcastle to the signing of Brazilian star Evander with David Beckham ready to splash £6m on the transfer'</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/07/46891747-0-image-m-13_1629439325226.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
David Beckham's Inter Miami are reportedly confident of beating Newcastle to the signing of Brazilian star Evander.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 23-year-old playmaker, who currently plays for Danish side FC Midtjylland, is wanted by both Phil Neville and Steve Bruce but the Inter Miami boss looks set to win the race with his former Manchester United team-mate.<br>
</p>
<p>
According to The Sun, Evander favours a move to the the MLS with Beckham ready to splash out £6million on the transfer. <br>
</p>
<p>
However, the club would have to get rid of one of their high earners to complete the move, with Blaise Matuidi and Rodolfo Pizarro reportedly both options.<br>
</p>
<p>
Pizarro scored a stunning injury time winner to help Miami beat Chicago 3-2 on Wednesday but has struggled for consistency for much of the season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Neville's side are in need of another creative player and Pizarro could be offloaded to make way for Evander, who scored seven goals and made nine assists for Midtjylland last season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Matuidi, whose signing landed the club in trouble for breaching salary cap rules, is thought to be another option.<br>
</p>
<p>
Miami were fined £1.41m in May after an MLS investigation found the signing contravened team roster designation rules for Matuidi and Andres Reyes who should have occupied a designated player slot.<br>
</p>
<p>
Evander will have to wait to make the move to Miami, with the MLS transfer window currently closed until the New Year.<br>
</p>
<p>
Neville's side are still in with a chance of making the play-offs after turning their form around followinng a poor start to the season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Miami went on a run of six straight defeats, including a 5-0 thrashing by New England, but have since taken 11 points from their last six fixtures. <br>
</p>
<p>
The club are eight points behind Montreal, who occupy the final play-off spot, but have two games in hand. <br>

<h2>
Jesse Lingard 'ready to LEAVE Man United this summer unless he receives assurances from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer he will play regularly' as he looks to revive his England career in time for the 2022 World Cup </h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/06/46891495-0-image-m-15_1629438367690.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Jesse Lingard is set to leave Manchester United this summer if he believes he is not going to play regularly, as he looks to boost his chances of returning to the international fold with England.<br>
</p>
<p>
The attacking midfielder fell out of favour at United and was sent out on loan to West Ham last season, where he won numerous plaudits for his performances. <br>
</p>
<p>
According to the Times, Lingard wants regular first-team football and could force a way out of Old Trafford by the transfer window deadline on August 31 to get it.<br>
</p>
<p>
The 28-year-old has impressed in pre-season after returning to Manchester, scoring against Queens Park Rangers and shining against Wayne Rooney's Derby.<br>
</p>
<p>
Although Covid-19 ruled him out of the club's Premier League opener, a 5-1 win against Leeds, he has returned the training pitch and scored again in a friendly against Burnley on Tuesday.<br>
</p>
<p>
Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is reportedly now mulling over whether to bring him in to the squad against Southampton on Sunday, but regular game-time is far from guaranteed with the Red Devils despite his fine pre-season and form last campaign.<br>
</p>
<p>
The talismanic Bruno Fernandes also prefers a central No 10 role, with United's winger positions well stocked with £73m signing Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood and Paul Pogba capable of playing out wide.<br>
</p>
<p>
It would be difficult for Lingard to leave the club he joined 21 years ago, but with one year left on his contract, he is willing to make that move to increase his chances of returning to Gareth Southgate's England squad. <br>
</p>
<p>
The Three Lions boss brought him into his provisional Euro 2020 squad but did not pick him in his final 23-man group - although he is said to be impressed by Lingard's attitude and performances upon returning to the team.<br>
</p>
<p>
Although it is understood one enquiry for the £25m-rated star was received from Italy, there have as yet not been any official bids for the player, with West Ham interested in re-signing him permanently but unwilling to pay the asking price.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lingard's stellar form at the London Stadium - with nine goals and five assists in just 16 appearances - saw David Moyes' Hammers finish sixth, missing out on Champions League football by just two points. <br>

Rio Ferdinand heaps praise on Mason Greenwood for his 'joke' performance against Leeds and says the Man United striker is growing into the frame of Wayne Rooney </h2>

<p>
Rio Ferdinand lauded Mason Greenwood for his 'joke' performance against Leeds and believes he's growing into the frame of Wayne Rooney.<br>
</p>
<p>
Greenwood opened his Premier League account as United thrashed Leeds at Old Trafford, with the teenager scoring the third goal with an exquisite finish.<br>
</p>
<p>
The striker has benefitted from having the summer off after pulling out of England's provisional squad for Euro 2020 and looked strong and sharp as he led the line for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side.<br>
</p>
<p>
And Ferdinand was full of praise for the 19-year-old. 'I saw some of the stuff in that game where I know some of the coaches and people behind the scenes at Man United are saying this isn't a surprise,' he explained on his FIVE Youtube channel.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It has just been waiting to happen in the first team and his body is catching up.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He knows what he needs to do. Wayne Rooney, when he came into the first team, was physically ready, he was a man already. You can see Mason Greenwood is growing into that frame.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Graeme Souness [who praised him on Sky Sports] was right, he was one of the stand-out players.<br>
</p>
<p>
'Some of the movement, the ball retention, shrugging people off and the finish was a joke.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He ran half the pitch and I always say to be able to run half the pitch and finish like that, to do something like that... I think if he had gone to the Euros, he would have had a massive impact off the bench.<br>
</p>
<p>
'He just knows how to score goals at any level.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Solskjaer was also full of prasie for Greenwood after his performance against Leeds and said the youngster 'turned into a man' over the summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
'I think you can see the benefit in his... I think you can see how much work he has put down this pre-season in his summer,' Solskjaer said. 'He's turned into a man. <br>
</p>
<p>
'He's filling out, he's stronger. His stride is stronger - you know, when he ran away from the defender and scored his goal, it was a joy to see.<br>
</p>
<p>
'His approach, attitude, application, everything he has done every day has been just better and better and I think that's maturity as well in the kid.'<br>

Mikel Arteta plotting late window firesale at Arsenal as he admits there's 'players in the squad where it's difficult for them to find game time' - with Willian, Eddie Nketiah and Ainsley Maitland-Niles on the trading block</h2>
<center><img src = "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/08/20/08/46894721-0-image-a-62_1629444784261.jpg"/img></center>
<p>
Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has revealed the club are planning to sell several players by the transfer window deadline at the end of the month.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Gunners have a bloated first-team squad and are looking to balance the books with a reported cull of six first-team stars, including former Chelsea midfielder Willian, planned after a £135million summer spending blowout.<br>
</p>
<p>
And ahead of Sunday's Premier League match against Chelsea, Arteta admitted the club was still aiming for several outgoings and conceded that spending the most money in the division brought pressure. <br>
</p>
<p>
He said: 'There's still 11 days to go and there's still things to be done. There are still players in the squad where it's going to be difficult for them to find game time.<br>
</p>
<p>
'It does (bring pressure). We will see what we will finish. We're gonna have I think seven players have left the club and five are coming in so it's not more players coming in. We're going to do it in the right way so that we are stable.'<br>
</p>
<p>
Joe Willock to Newcastle for £22m was the only major departure, with David Luiz released and William Saliba and Matteo Guendouzi joining Marseille and Konstantinos Mavropanos joining Stuttgart on loan deals.<br>
</p>
<p>
Arsenal signed attacking midfielder Martin Odegaard from Real Madrid on Friday for £30m, while Sheffield United goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale has carried out a medical and is set to complete a move for around the same fee in the near future.<br>
</p>
<p>
Those signings join £50m centre half Ben White, £18m midfielder Albert Sambi Lokonga and £7m left back Nuno Tavares in what was a lavish transfer window for the north London side.<br>
</p>
<p>
According to the Mirror, Arsenal and technical director Edu will now turn to trimming their squad and reducing their net spend, and have therefore placed six first-team players up for sale.<br>
</p>
<p>
Willian, Eddie Nketiah, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Lucas Torreira, Reiss Nelson and Sead Kolasinac are reportedly the players in question, with difficulty expected in selling Willian, with two years left on the 32-year-old's gargantuan £200,000-a-week deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
Nketiah and Nelson have been linked with Crystal Palace, with Leicester, Southampton and Burnley keen on Maitland-Niles - although he could stay as back-up if Hector Bellerin leaves - while Kolasinac could join Mesut Ozil at Fenerbahce.<br>

Trevoh Chalobah is now set to STAY at Chelsea with new contract in the pipeline after impressing Thomas Tuchel... but  left-back Emerson Palmieri joins Lyon on season-long loan</h2>

<p>
Chelsea are discussing a new contract for defender Trevoh Chalobah after he impressed boss Thomas Tuchel. <br>
</p>
<p>
The 22-year-old had been touted for a loan move this season but is now set to stay at Stamford Bridge.<br>
</p>
<p>
Chalobah followed a strong pre-season by scoring a spectacular goal in the 3-0 win over Crystal Palace last Saturday. <br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Blues defender Emerson Palmieri has joined Lyon on loan for the remainder of the season.<br>
</p>
<p>
Lyon will pay a fee of around £420,000 for the 27-year-old Brazil-born Italy international, who can play at left-back or wing-back, who joined Chelsea from Roma in January 2018.<br>
</p>
<p>
Emerson, who was part of Italy's Euro 2020 winning squad, came off the bench in the Premier League opener against Crystal Palace, which was his 71st Chelsea appearance. <br>
</p>
<p>
Chelsea are close to agreeing several loan moves for their fringe players. Marseille are in talks to sign striker Ike Ugbo.<br>
</p>
<p>
Midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko is closing on another loan move to AC Milan after extending his contract at Stamford Bridge. <br>
</p>
<p>
Centre back Matt Miazga is expected to sign for Alaves on loan on Friday.  <br>

<p>
The pair missed last Friday’s season curtain-raiser at Brentford - a game they lost 2-0 - under mysterious circumstances as the club failed to disclose the reasons behind their absence.<br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday that the game was just hours away from being called off after the entire travelling Arsenal party were forced to take emergency Covid tests on the day of the game.<br>
</p>
<p>
And we can now verify that the unscheduled round of testing was due to the positive tests of four Gunners players - Aubameyang, Lacazette, Willian and Alex Runarsson - in the lead up to the game. <br>
</p>
<p>
Sportsmail understands that staff were asked to take additional tests on Saturday, a scheduled day off.<br>
</p>
<p>
Captain Aubameyang, whose wife Alysha posted pictures on social media of a family birthday party just days before the striker’s positive test, has now recorded a negative result and will be assessed ahead of Sunday’s home game against Chelsea. <br>
</p>
<p>
Such parties are permitted under the Government’s new relaxed Covid guidelines. <br>
</p>
<p>
Lacazette and Runarsson are still recovering and won’t be available for the visit of the European champions but Willian is being assessed ahead of the clash against his former club.<br>
</p>
<p>
Premier League clubs are testing twice a week but there was enough concern over Arsenal’s visit to newly promoted Brentford that Gunners players, the coaching team and other associated staff were told to take tests on the day of the game.<br>
